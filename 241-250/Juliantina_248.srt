1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,220
Calm down.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,720
It's all my fault.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,780
Valentina, don't say that.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,100
I shouldn't have left him.
It's not your fault.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,020
I'll get her some water.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,940
Okay, thank you.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,700
Clearly, it's my fault.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,180
Don't say that. Hey, listen to me.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,320
Listen to me.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,360
Don't you dare say that.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,040
It's not your fault.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
It's my fault and...
No, no.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,680
Those people have to pay.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,600
They're going to.

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
No, no, you're wrong.
The police..

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,440
The police will get them, Valentina.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,840
I really don't understand.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,780
I swear, they need to catch them.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,400
They're going to.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,980
They will catch who's guilty. Listen to me, Valentina. Look at me.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
It's not your fault.

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,620
Don't blame yourself because you're not to blame.

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,620
Calm down.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,260
Please.. please..

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,280
Please.. Don't go..

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,819
Don't go, please because..

27
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,300
Renata and I are going to stay for as long as necessary. Until you're okay.

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,940
You're not going to be alone.

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,040
Okay?

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm sorry, Vale.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
You know, you always have my support.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,580
I'll always be here for you.

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,600
What happened?

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,200
What happened is that, Valentina's friend, Juliana was kidnapped and..

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,160
There was a confrontation between the criminals and the police

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,440
And unfortunately, Lucho, her boyfriend...

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,140
Died.
What?

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
Valentina, I'm so sorry.

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,780
Valentina was there when it happened.

40
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,820
Jacobo, too.

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:00:00,000
Jacobo?
