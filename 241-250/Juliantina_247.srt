1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,960
Okay, so..

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,720
If this is all true then who is that outside?

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,520
A poor old millionaire.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,620
Don't make fun of me.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,160
I'm not making fun of you, I swear.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,640
It seems like a bad joke..

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,120
Of life and death, I don't know.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,180
Can you Imagine? I always wanted to be a millionaire...

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,620
And now he's there and I'm in this body.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,020
Why did you come for me?

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,600
Because when I knew you had been kidnapped,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
I felt a weird thing inside of me.

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,580
That you are my daughter.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,200
And I...

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,000
It takes a lot for me to say these things.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
Forgive me.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,480
My new life has taught me many things and..

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,700
I don't want to lose you again.

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,680
Does my mom know about all of this?

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,140
Almost everything.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't know I'm El Chino Vald√©s.
