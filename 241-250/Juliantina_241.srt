1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,120
This woman is still alive?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,560
You're a dumbass.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,880
How many lives do you all have?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,780
Let her go.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,400
I'll do anything you ask, but please let her go.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
I don't care how many lives you have.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,900
Today they're all going to end.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,980
Kill her.
No, no.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,720
No, we had a deal.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,360
What?

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,980
What?

12
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,280
Hey?

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,560
You're lucky that AlacrÃ¡n will be the one to kill you.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,360
Kill her.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,140
No, no, no, mom!

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Help!

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,960
Mrs, what's happening? Are you okay?
Help me.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,940
Lupita! What about Juliana?

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,080
Calm down, please. They're women.

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,780
Calm down? I'm not calm.

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,640
Hello.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,220
No, please.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,840
Hey, please.

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
Please, don't do it.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,080
Let's go!

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,280
Lucho, Lucho.

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,320
Lucho!

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,880
Surround the perimeter.

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
Enter the house.

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,140
What do we do? Someone help me, please!

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,580
Call an ambulance!

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,880
Please!

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,680
The USB.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,820
I have the USB.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:00:00,000
Run! Run!
