1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,440
No, no, wait, no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,340
What do you mean he's my dad?

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,740
I've been trying to explain for a long time.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
No, what are you saying?

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,560
I'll explain later, okay?

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,140
No, explain it now.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,960
Let's go.
Go where?

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,860
I've already done what I came to do, the police can handle the rest.

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,500
What? No, I'm not going without my mom!

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,400
You'll do what I say to do.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
The important thing is that we get out of here safely.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,180
Do you recognize me now?

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,880
Let's go.

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,780
They don't listen.

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,420
Where is Juliana?

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,540
Where is she?

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,180
Ladies..

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,620
We have to go.

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,200
We want to see what is happening with Juliana's case and there's no point keeping us locked in here.

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,340
What is going on?

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,820
You have to wait for Inspector Montilla and he will let you know.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,620
Please.
No.

23
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,340
I don't want to wait for anyone. I want to leave, please.

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,400
Miss, you can't leave.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm going to leave.

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,620
By the way, I have news for you.

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,460
I don't know if you have heard but...

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Your brother was released today.

29
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,020
I didn't know if you knew?

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,040
Guille was released?

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,540
Yes.

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,680
He's out.

33
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,400
Guille was released.

34
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,380
It's Valentina.

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,320
Little sister..

36
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm a free man.

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,220
What do you think?

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,900
That's great Guille, I've just found out.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm at the police station.

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,140
What are you doing there?

41
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,280
Lucho was killed.

42
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,460
Lucho?

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,380
Who?

44
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,040
It's complicated, it's only just happened.

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,140
I'll tell you later.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,080
Okay, don't move. I'm on my way.

47
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,640
What's happening, Guille? Who's Lucho?

48
00:01:37,640 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me, I'll tell you.
