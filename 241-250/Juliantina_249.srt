1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Well, I don't think it's that strange because

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,980
He is a hitman.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,820
I can imagine.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,540
What does that have to do with him being at the kidnapping of his own daughter?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,540
I don't think so.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,500
Maybe it's his fault that they took her?

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,560
It all happened so fast.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,060
We...

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,420
We got there,

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,440
Lupita showed up and a guy came behind her and he

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,820
Didn't give him a chance to do or say anything and..

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,860
He shot him.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,940
I'm sorry you're going through so much pain, Valentina.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,680
It's unbelievable, I can't..

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,020
Believe for such a long time...

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,980
We had a criminal among us.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
Hey, we're not sure about that, Johnny.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,140
Guille, I know that it's..

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,640
It's a surprise for everyone but..

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,320
From what I know,

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,260
Jacobo is a good person.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,120
We all thought the same but..

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
Even Interpol are looking for him and..

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,440
It could be a mistake.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,800
It could be.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,640
Valentina.

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,260
I'm here for whatever you need.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
It's nice to see you here, Guille.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,140
And thank you, really.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,480
I know you had something to do with my release.

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,540
I did what I had to do.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,440
Thank you.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,340
Let's go to the studio, I need to talk to you.

35
00:01:46,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.
