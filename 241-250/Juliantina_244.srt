1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
I'm scared to open the door.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,240
You bring more people every time.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,380
Who is this?

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,400
My daughter.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,120
Enough with this, okay?

6
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,060
The one who has the face and body of my dad is him, not you.

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,500
You're driving me crazy, you're both wrong.
Hey, look, look...

8
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,945
But, this is...

9
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,435
It's the truth.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,120
I just hope that the shot I fired puts Alacrán...

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,360
Out of business.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,100
It’s best if the police get him, no?

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,460
No, if the police get him, it will be like nothing happened. He'd escape.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,740
Do you want something to drink?

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,360
Yes?
Yes, thank you.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,620
I don't understand why you had to tell the girl the truth.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,180
Surely, she wasn't prepared.
That's not it.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,180
It's not about whether she's prepared or not, it's about telling her the truth, right?

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,160
Yes, but..

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,500
Excuse me for saying this but, it's not your place to gossip.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,260
Ah, gossip?

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,700
Yes, gossip.
So, you think I have nothing to do with her?

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,460
Well, you're right.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,320
After what's happened, the least someone could do was tell her the truth, no?

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,000
And you?

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,620
Me, what?

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,240
When are you going to tell the truth to yours?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, they're very confused too.
