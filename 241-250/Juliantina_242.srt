1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,040
What do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,400
You have to go back inside.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,000
You have to go back to save Juliana!

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,340
Look, Miss Valentina, calm down.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,540
It's not safe for them to be here. Take them.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,080
No. 
No, no, no! I'm not leaving without my daughter!

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,920
That's enough. Enough!
Don't touch me.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,520
Understand me, Mrs!

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,200
It's not safe for you to be here. What do you want?

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,160
To get all of us killed?

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,160
Go get in the police car.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Don't touch me!
Go!

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,780
Hey, stop! Calm down, hey.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,140
Are you okay? Youâ€™re safe.
Yes, I'm okay. I'm fine.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,080
What are you doing here, hey?

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,400
Where is my mom?

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
This isn't the time to explain, calm down.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,600
So, now you're my dad, or what?

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,700
No, there's your dad.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:00,000
My child.
