1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
No, no, no, no, no. They...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,800
They grabbed me for killing a judge, remember? I was sent to the electric chair.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,300
That was Chino, not you.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,400
Okay, listen. Then you saw a guy come out of the morgue, right?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,020
As if nothing had happened, as if he hadn't received 2,500 volts.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,160
Did you see it or not?
Yes, obviously.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,860
It's weird, no?
Yes, it's really weird.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,940
Well, that guy you seen...

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,360
Is Jacobo, the man outside.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,460
He's not your father.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,940
Your father is here, in the body of a university teacher.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,380
And don't give me that face.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,580
It's weird.

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,740
Everyone does that.

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,160
It's the truth, what do you want me to do?

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,580
Of course they do. I know what is happening.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,080
What?

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,360
Clearly, Chino is paying you, right? To say these things.

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,620
Why are you so stubborn?

20
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,720
Like always!

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,600
Listen!

22
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,220
Why would I go through all of this to rescue you?

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,040
That's the problem.

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,940
El Chino would never do that because El Chino doesn't care about me, okay?

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,240
Chino never wanted to recognize that he was my dad.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,680
Are you going back there again?

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,840
Again...

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,740
Of course, he's leaving.

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,100
He's going to his other house that...

30
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,060
Other house? Shut your mouth, okay. There is no other house.

31
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,560
Until when, are you going to keep taking risks with your family?

32
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,620
Your daughter is figuring out...
My daughter?

33
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,660
Yes, your daughter.

34
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,820
Again you tell me about 'my daughter'.

35
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,080
Chino, please.
Chino, nothing.

36
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,800
Not again with 'my daughter'.

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,360
Is it really difficult to explain to me what you do?

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,160
I understand why you say that.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,720
The truth is, I wasn't a good guy with you when you were a little girl, but...

40
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,520
There is a reason that you don't know.

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,960
Your mother cheated on me with a guy.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
And I never

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:00:00,000
Believed that you were my daughter.
