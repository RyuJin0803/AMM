1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,800
Mom, I'm okay.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,200
Beltrán is with me, he will take me home later.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,100
Juliana showed up.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,700
She messaged me to say she's okay.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,980
She's with Beltrán.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,960
Are you serious?

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,600
Come here. That's good.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
You shouldn't have gone to that place, girl.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,300
You didn't think about what you could be exposed to.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,480
You had already done enough giving us the address  and warning us of the kidnapping.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,720
I want to see Lucho.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,640
That's not possible at the moment.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,560
You'll have to wait until the funeral.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,980
Besides, we still need your statement.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,380
What's wrong with you?

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,180
With everything that's happened, she shouldn't even be here.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,620
Can't you see the state that this girl is in?

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
When she feels better, she will come back and give her statement.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,240
Fine.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,960
Call someone to come for you.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,480
I didn't know it was you who called the police.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
