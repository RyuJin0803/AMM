1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
My child, my child, my child.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,820
Mom.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,420
Juli, I don't know what I would do if something had happened to you, my love.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,080
You're okay, you're fine.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,700
Ahh my life.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,220
Come. Are you hungry? 
Mom, don't cry, don't cry.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,180
Come on, come, eat something.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,420
Do you want something to drink?

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,920
No mom,  I don't want anything. I'm fine, okay?

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm so happy.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,800
Thank you for saving my daughter.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,420
Again, you're my angel.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,520
Mom.

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,400
Besides bringing me here, BeltrÃ¡n has something else to tell you.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,820
He's not your angel.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
He's someone else.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,660
Well...

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,580
Leave, I want to talk with them.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,220
No.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of him.
