1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I told you, he left.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,940
He didn't care about your threats.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,500
Why do these things keep happening to me?

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,740
Don't you dare tell me absolutely nothing, Beltrán, because I'm fed up.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,860
Fed up of everything.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,980
This is about my daughter's life.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,940
Don't you get that we're running out of time?

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,800
Here.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,620
Take it.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,860
See, I'm not that bad.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,300
What happens is that, in this business..

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,400
Betrayal is paid for with life.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,320
And El Chino has been escaping responsibility for a long time.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,920
And you know who's next on the list?

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,840
The family.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,840
But, hey.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,040
I've like you since the first time I saw you.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
Maybe we can pay this debt in another way.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
I also love fresh meat.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,960
What do you say?

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,100
I'd rather burn to death than be with someone as disgusting as you.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,800
If only you knew the success I have with high society women.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,940
They even call me to make babies.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,180
That's suicide.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
Well, it's over.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,200
Turn on the grill.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,440
Also, cover your ears, this one is going to scream worse than a pig.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,160
Alacrán.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,240
We just got a message from Chino.

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,920
El Chino? Hold on.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Let me see.

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,120
See.

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,620
It's seems like your dad still loves you.

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:00:00,000
He says he is going to give himself up for you.
