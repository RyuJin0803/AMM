1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,120
You don't get how hard it was for me to understand all of this.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,840
The man with Chino's face and Chino's body is not Chino.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,580
And now it turns out that Beltrán has him and is going to exchange him for my daughter.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,320
This is all very complicated.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,940
What worries me is that...

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,900
If he is telling the truth and has nothing to do with this and gets killed...

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,200
Lupita.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,320
If this man has the face of Chino Valdés, he is Chino Valdés.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,120
It's him.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,380
It's Beltrán.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,240
I have to go.
I'll go with you.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,020
No, you're not coming. I can't put you in danger.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,400
I'll go with you to look out for you.
No, no Pancho.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,620
I'm going to see Jacobo, I need to clear this up.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,560
I don't know if it's a good idea to give him to Alacrán.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,380
Okay.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,200
Be careful.

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,740
Are you listening?

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,220
Hey.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,800
Are you listening to me?

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,700
Yes.
So leave that then.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm asking you that if you know Beltrán better than me,

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,800
Would he really be capable of turning me in, or not?

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,120
The truth is that..

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,100
I've never seen him like this. So...

26
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,140
So desperate.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,120
Well, that's normal, no?

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
I have a daughter. I think any man would do that for his daughter.

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,940
But you also have your life and..

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,960
Well..

31
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,920
I mean León Carvajal does.

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,560
I...this is a mess, honestly.

33
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,140
Yes, I know this is a mess, but it's bigger than Chino's and the transmigrated bodies.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,000
What? Explain. You're like Beltrán, I don't understand what you're saying. What?

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,240
It's that his daughter and my daughter...

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
What?
Nothing, they're..

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:00:00,000
They're in love.
