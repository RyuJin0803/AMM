00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,460
Hey.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,480
No.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,700
I have to explain to you what happened.
I don't want to talk to you.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,220
Juliana and I only..

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,680
Look, I'm going to say one thing.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,380
The important thing right now is that she comes back safe and sound,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,400
And I have no intention of knowing what happened between you two.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,880
So leave it.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,080
I'm running out of patience, girl.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,900
Tell me where your dad is.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,460
Or are we passed the screaming and begging?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,820
Well, you're gonna have to kill me because I don't know where Chino is.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,820
You've helped us a lot with AlacrÃ¡n's location.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,620
I will do the rest of the rescuing.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,460
Whatever you want to do,

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Just don't put my daughter's life at risk.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,440
I won't.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,960
Yours either.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
I know how to handle these..

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,340
Rescue things, very well.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,040
Relax.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,500
You really think that Jacobo..

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,460
is El Chino?

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,700
He looks just like him.

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,640
The eyes..

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,120
The face is the same.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Well, yes..

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
But

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,800
If you look closely...

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,540
Let's not waste time discussing this.

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,640
Your daughter is in danger, so..

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
We will talk later.

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:00:00,000
Go inside.
