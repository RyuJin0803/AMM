1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,940
Why didn't you go to the police? I don't understand.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,140
I've already told you.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,300
Beltrán is in charge.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,180
You're going to leave your daughter's life in the hands of someone we don't know?

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,020
Beltrán saved my life when those narcos were going to kill me.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,200
He knows how to deal with them, he has a plan.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,780
It doesn't matter that he has a plan. You're being so naive, really.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,200
Can you calm down, please?

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,440
She's her mom, I'm sure she knows what she's doing, okay?

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,360
Calm down.

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,860
Are you really dating my daughter?

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,000
I can't believe that is a priority for you right now.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,080
It really doesn't matter who your daughter is with. Whether she's with me or with him.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,160
You know that your daughter is an important person in my life

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,400
And I'm not going to sit here with my arms crossed, okay?

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm going to do something!

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,580
Val.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,360
Val, wait.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,920
Val.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,120
You know, I think you should go home in a taxi because..

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't want to be with you.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,480
Hey, look.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,580
What happened is serious, okay. You shouldn't be alone.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,000
How nice.

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,880
How nice of you, now you want to be a friend and worry about me.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,020
I don't want to forgive you, you crossed the line.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have done that.
