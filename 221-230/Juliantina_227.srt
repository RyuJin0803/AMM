1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,380
Lupita.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,040
What is she doing here?

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,800
Why did you let her in?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,460
If it wasn't for her, my daughter wouldn't have been kidnapped.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,980
Calm down, please.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
Valentina is worried, too.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,540
Oh of course she's worried.
Yes.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,120
It's all her fault, I don't want her here.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,080
I don't want her here!

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,060
I'm sorry, Mrs, but if anyone is to blame, it's me.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,960
Juliana was with me yesterday and I let her leave alone.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,840
Who are you?

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,220
I'm a friend of...
He's your daughter's boyfriend.

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,940
But you don't have a problem with that, right?

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,120
Don't mock me.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,560
I'm not joking, I'm serious.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,860
Can we talk about what's important, please?

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,380
Valentina has a point, Lupita.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
What do we know about Juliana?

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,060
The only thing I know is that my daughter is in danger.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think I'm here?
