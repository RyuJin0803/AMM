1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
My brother is lucky to have someone who loves him like you do.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,900
Valentina.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,640
Your brother has changed my life.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,960
And you, how are things with...

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,060
- What's her name?
- Juliana.

6
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:24,000
I heard you two had problems,
but didn't know how it ended up.

7
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,225
We broke up.

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,705
It was too hard, you know.

9
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:35,945
Our families didn't...

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,215
Didn't help at all.

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,455
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:43,415
I understand.

13
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:48,000
You think you know someone,

14
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,435
And then you realize that you don't.

15
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,185
Really don't.

16
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,600
- Hi, Perla, I'm looking for Juliana.
- Something horrible has happened.

17
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:14,300
- Juliana was kidnapped right here.
- What? What happened?

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know, her mother is handling it.
