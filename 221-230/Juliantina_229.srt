1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
I don't understand.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,920
If Jacobo ran away, why are you leaving a message for the narcos?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,300
Why do you think?

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,940
If I knew I wouldn't be asking, Beltrán.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,980
Because Alacrán probably has my daughter with a gun to her head right now.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,760
Or worse, he's torturing her.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,640
Jacobo needs to be here now. He needs to show up.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,940
Why is he doing this to me?!

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,220
But you can do it to him, right?
Really?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,520
Now you're going to give me morality lessons?

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,340
You're too late.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,580
You keep behaving like the same criminal you were in your other life.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,340
Without realizing that you're in the body of an innocent man.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Your criminal soul makes you want to sell the soul of your own mother.
