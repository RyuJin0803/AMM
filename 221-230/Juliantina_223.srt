1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,640
What is it?

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,400
The magic of the microwave.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,940
Don't judge me. I may not be a cook but I'm a great witch.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, keep telling me about your daughter and Beltrán's daughter.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,680
Are they girlfriends, how do they...

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,320
I don't have the details, there's a relationship.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,100
That's it.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,400
I can imagine Beltrán's face when he finds out.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,860
He's so macho.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,100
Are you finding this funny or?

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,980
Truthfully, yes.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,480
But I don't think that it's a coincidence, it's destiny.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,360
You were marked to find each other.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,080
By the transmigration of your souls

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,960
Or by your daughters meeting.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,660
Yes.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,660
So one thing...

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,180
Perhaps...

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,740
Lead to the other.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,660
I mean..

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,980
Yes, it's clear that this has some reason. I imagine this isn't just about me helping Beltrán

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,160
To save his daughter. There's got to be something more.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,260
Yes.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,380
Yes, what?

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,660
Do you need salt for...

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:00:00,000
It's good.
