1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
We've already passed this street, Lupita.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,080
I'm not sure, all these houses look the same.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,580
Yes, but we've been doing this for so long.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,540
I'm going to ask some guys I know to take me to the area.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,660
Wait, wait, wait.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,060
Do I stop?
Here.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,640
By those men.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,560
That's the house.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,020
My child.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,080
Someone's looking for you.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,780
Come in, please.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,780
Thank you.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,760
I can't believe it. You really had the guts to come here.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,780
Can you just listen to me, please.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,840
No, not really, no.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,220
I don't want to.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,560
You were like a brother to me and...

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,820
I can't believe you could do that to me. You don't do things like that.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,340
We've been friends since we were kids.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,900
I think you better leave.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,460
I get that you're...
Sergio, I'm serious.

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,280
I understand perfectly why you're mad at me, okay?

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm an idiot, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Yes, you are an idiot.

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,740
But I came here because I have something important to tell you.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,560
Juliana was kidnapped.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:00:00,000
What?
