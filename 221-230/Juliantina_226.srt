1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,520
No, no, please, no.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,880
No, I told you I don't know anything, I swear.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,240
Okay, little girl.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,280
No.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,500
I'll give you one last opportunity.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,060
You either tell us, or I'll feed you to the dogs.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,140
I've told you, I don't know anything. I swear, please..

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,540
Don't hurt me, I have nothing to do with this.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,040
What a shame such a pretty face like yours

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,660
Has to be wasted, for a guy who is worthless.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,280
I swear, the last time I seen him was at the hospital, when he killed Servando Armenta.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,240
And then all I know is that he ran away because he knew he would get killed, please.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,800
Look no more.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,060
Chino, always being careful.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,440
He says that his name isn't Chino, that it's Jacobo.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,260
And now he's lost his memory, too.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, please. Don't hurt me, I swear I don't know anything. I swear.
