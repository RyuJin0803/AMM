1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,340
I want to report the kidnapping of my daughter.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,960
My name is Lupita ValdÃ©s and...

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,120
What are you doing? I'm calling the police.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,540
Don't get the police involved, they'll mess it up.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,040
They don't know how to confront a narco.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,720
And how do you know a narco took my daughter?

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,500
This is not a normal kidnapping.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
It's Alacran's people.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,840
But, I have friends who can help me rescue Juliana.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,560
How do you have friends like that if you're a professor?

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,660
In this business, the less you ask the better.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Business?

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,440
But you're a stranger. I'm not going to put my daughter's life in your hands.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,860
I'm going to the police.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,840
Lupita, what are you doing?

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,520
Do you want to risk Juliana's life, or what?

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,740
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,860
Listen, I'm a man who keeps his word.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,840
I won't fail you.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,540
I swear on my life.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,440
I am going to rescue Juliana.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down.
