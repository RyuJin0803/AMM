1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
I'm going to be a father!

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,019
For my kid.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,880
Sir, we have Chino's daughter.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,340
Well, in that case, bring the champagne, we have a lot to celebrate.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,840
Cheers.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,440
Congratulations, dad.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,820
No, no, calm down.

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,480
Why won't you answer me, Juliana.

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,400
How are you holding up?

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,500
I am.

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,200
Can I?

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,680
Is there anything new with Guille?

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,280
Yes.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,080
I went to...

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,180
To try and convince the woman of the person they hurt..

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,580
With Renata.

17
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,360
She was, I don't know.. stubborn.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,020
They're not going to lift the charges.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,080
I'm so sorry for what's happening.

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:00:00,000
Me too.
