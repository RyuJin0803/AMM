1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
You're shameless for coming here.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,700
Calm down Ma'am. Please listen, we want to talk to you.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,360
I don't want to talk to anyone who has anything to do with that criminal.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,160
Guillermo is not a criminal, okay?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,260
Please, I'm asking you to take the time to watch the video again because

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,080
You will see that he is trying to stop the assault and he is just as surprised.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,540
Exactly.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,280
If it had been on purpose, he would not have helped you. You have seen everything he has done for you.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,660
Who are you?

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm his sister, okay. It's very frustrating to see my brother paying for something he didn't do.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,560
Guille is from a good family.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,840
They are not criminals.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm very sorry but it's that..

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,060
My brother-in-law is in a wheelchair now and..

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,820
Someone has to pay and...

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,500
Your brother is guilty, he was there with his friend.

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm very sorry.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,820
And in these pages you can find information on homosexuality.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,360
There are so many things.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,340
Everything, and plus...

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,080
You can make an appointment to see a specialist.

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,700
Oh, no.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,100
Panchito, it's too much information.

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,440
Lupita, you have to do it so you can understand it better.

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
You think so? I don't know..
Yes.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,680
There's nothing wrong with it.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,980
Wait.
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
He's here again?

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,300
Don't you have a job? You are here all the time.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,960
I need to speak to you Lupita, but..

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:00:00,000
Alone.
