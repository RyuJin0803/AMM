00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Thank you, Lupita.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,080
Do you know when you're leaving?

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,700
Not yet.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,140
Why do you have that face?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,340
Something happened?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
Did that guy do something to you?

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,920
No, no.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,580
No, Panchito has always behaved well with me.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,960
The problem is my daughter.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,200
Juliana.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,080
What's happened with Juliana?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,020
She left home.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,460
What do you mean she left home? Where has she gone?

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,540
It's hard for me to tell you but...

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,660
Since you're a professor and...

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,780
You must be used to dealing with kids..

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,400
You can understand and even advise me, right?

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,040
Okay, I can give you advice. What happened?

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,540
I found out that my daughter is in a homosexual relationship.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,920
Can you repeat that? I don't understand.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,200
That my daughter...

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,000
Likes women.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:00:00,000
What?
