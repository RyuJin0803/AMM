1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,840
You know, since my dad died...

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,300
There isn't a single bit of good news in this house. Everything is..

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,880
Negative. I don't know what...

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,460
I don't know what's happening.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:22,960
What?

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,520
I have good news.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,480
I mean it.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,060
Are you serious?

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,740
You're going to be an aunt.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,160
You're going to be an aunt, Vale.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,480
Stop.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,960
I'm super sensitive right now, don't play with me.
I'm not joking.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,100
No, no. It's the truth.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,240
Eva is pregnant, you're gonna be an aunt.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,420
I am?

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,660
Yes.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to be an aunt?

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,020
Yes, you'll be an aunt.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,140
Really?

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,700
Yes, really.
I can't believe it.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,700
I'm going to be an aunt! 
You're going to be an aunt.

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,520
Can I be the godmother to?

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,340
Wait a minute..

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,640
It has to be named Valentina.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,440
Please, it's a great name., you have to call it Valentina.
We have to talk to Eva.

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,520
Is everything okay?

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,080
I know.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,920
I know. I can't believe I'm going to be the godmother. We talked and I'm going to be the godmother.

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,280
And it will be named Valentina, or Valentino.

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,780
Mateo.

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,400
I said we were going to wait to tell everyone.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,160
I had to tell your sister, how can I not? She's going to be an aunt, my love.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,460
Baby...

34
00:01:36,980 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, my love. Not that face, I had to tell your sister.
I'm so happy.
