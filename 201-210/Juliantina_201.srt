1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,060
You should have seen,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,060
Guille felt very guilty from the beginning.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,480
The whole time he was..

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,280
Miles away, unfocused, like very tense, very nervous, very stressed.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,000
And he was looking for a way to help Mr Castillo but we didn't know how.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Okay, and what happened? What did you do?

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,720
We pretended to be a foundation.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,400
A foundation?

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,140
Yes, and we offered our help.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,640
That was they only way we could reach them where they would accept us.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,400
Okay, so you were in contact with them. You saw them, you visited them.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
Well yes, more or less.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,060
We visited them.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,020
Guille was always looking out for them.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,960
He paid for Mr Castillo's operation, his wheelchair...

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,980
His physical therapy.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,960
Plus, they even became friends.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,040
Poor Guille.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,380
Then we have to do something because if they were friends,

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,020
We have to explain to this person.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,460
No, Valentina. I'd love to, I swear but..

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,440
Yesterday, when I left their house..

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
They were so hurt.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,380
Renata, we have to try, we have to do something.
They were disappointed.

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,900
You don't know the look they gave me.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,500
They felt betrayed.

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,440
I don't think they will forgive us.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,460
Ren, we have to try.

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,220
I'm so scared, Valentina.

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so scared that they will take this case to it's last consequences.
