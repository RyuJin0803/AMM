1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
What are you talking about? Who is 'El Chino'?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,560
My ex-husband.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,940
Your ex-husband? As far as I know, you're still married.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,380
He disappeared.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
But we aren't talking about that.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,120
Who are you?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,160
Your guardian angel, didn't you say?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,820
You reacted exactly the same as Juliana's father would.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,500
Why do you talk to me like you've known me for years?

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,880
Anyone...

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,740
Would say the same thing about a girl who you are in charge of...

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Growing up crooked.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,700
Why do you blame me?

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,800
You don't know me.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,360
Or do you?

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,660
Hello.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,180
Lupita, something frightening happened.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,420
Juliana was kidnapped.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you mean Juliana was kidnapped?

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,320
Yes, she is taken by some men.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,620
It just happened. That's why I'm calling you.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm going to call the police right away.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,300
What happened?

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,620
Juliana was kidnapped!

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:00:00,000
What?
