1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,460
No.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,100
- Vale, can I come in?
- No!

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,900
I was waiting for you.

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,880
I don't feel well.

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,260
Oh, Valentina!

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,880
How are you supposed to feel well with that kind of attitude?

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,680
I made you an appointment with a doctor who's friend of mine.

8
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,220
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,500
- He's a psychologist.
- You do get that I'm not sick right?

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,040
- Believe me, this is for your own good.
- Oh! Please.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You know what's the problem? The thing is

12
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,920
That you think you know what everyone else needs.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,660
But you don't.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,480
No, you don't even notice them, you don't care.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,140
Besides,

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,680
You live like three generations ago,

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Which is very frustrating and make me feel really bad.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,940
I'm a little embarrassed that your'e my sister, to be honest.

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,900
One day you'll be grateful, Vale.

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,900
I'm going to send you a text with the address and the time of the appointment.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,680
I do this

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I love you.
