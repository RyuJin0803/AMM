1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
You know what? I'll drive, you're very drunk.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,300
What would I do without you, champ?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,100
You're my best friend, you know.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,240
I thought that was Lucho.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,600
That guy...

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
Well, are you gonna tell me why you fought, or not?

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,700
The truth is, Lucho's an idiot.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,380
He thinks he's a man but he's just a little girl.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,260
and when things don't go how he wants,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,100
he has a tantrum.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,820
But he is still your best friend.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,240
No, not anymore.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,880
I'm sick of him and his stupidity.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,780
On one hand I understand Valentina, replacing him with someone else.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,360
What a pain to deal with a dude like that.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,420
And Juliana is pretty,

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,280
she's beautiful.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,960
Wait, what? You're talking about Valentina's friend, The one you like?

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,780
Yes.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,580
Her.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,140
She and Valentina voted us out,

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,300
now they're together.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
What?

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,520
You're telling me Valentina left Lucho for a woman?

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Yeah.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,980
I can't believe it.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'm not saying anything.
