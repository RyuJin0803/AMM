1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
[Sierra's Cartel member brutally murdered in his cell]

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,240
Juliana!

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,080
Come here!

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,920
What's wrong?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,720
Look what's on the newspaper.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Look.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,380
They killed one of Alacran's men.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,520
The one who kidnapped me.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,980
He shot me.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,200
It says he was found dead in his cell.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,860
And it seems to have been a revenge by his own Cartel.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,360
Imagine if they find out I'm in this city.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,380
This time they will kill me.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,780
No, mom, don't say that. No.

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,160
What if we leave?

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm feeling better.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
We can't risk me being killed.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey, where are you going?
- I need to make a call.
