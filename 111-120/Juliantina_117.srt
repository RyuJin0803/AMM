1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,420
What's going on, honey? You look even more crushed than last night.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
Come on, Juli. Tell me.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,320
You're not going to say anything?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,840
We used to tell each other everything.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,120
Mom, leave it.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,340
I don't want to talk.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,560
Okay, but I just want to know what's going on.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,060
You have a boyfriend and you had a fight with him?

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,500
I don't have a boyfriend.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,640
Did you fight with your friend?

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,920
Mhmm.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,620
I knew it.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,400
You had a fight with Valentina.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,760
It was obvious it was going to happen.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,820
That girl is... Beautiful, she's a good person, likeable, but--

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,400
She's from a different world, Juli.

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,700
- You two are like water and oil--
- And who asked for your opinion?

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Fine, but don't be like that.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,820
No, I will be like that.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,340
I don't interfere in your thing with Panchito, do I?

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,100
- I don't say that you take advantage of him because he has feelings for you.
- That's not true!

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,920
It is true, because you only speak to him when you feel like it.

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,600
Don't be rude! Do not speak to me like that!

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, don't stick you nose in my business and that's it! How about that?
