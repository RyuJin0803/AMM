00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,500
Miss.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Is something wrong?

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,660
Everything, Jacobo.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,540
Has the drunk man come to bother you again?

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,180
It's that people are very cruel. Very cruel.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,540
Let's see, tell me what's wrong.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,720
I feel alone.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,360
I have no friends.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,720
Guille left the house.

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,980
Why did Guille leave the house?

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,820
He fought with Eva. Maybe I should do the same.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,940
Ahh don't say that.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Seriously, I'm being serious.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,280
Your father broke his back all his life to give you...

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,100
this house with everything you have. And the reality is that you have an older sister and you can rely on her.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,840
Older sister..

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,640
An older sister who is an authoritarian, aggressive...

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,920
who I don't care for, she doesn't help me at all.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Life is full of bad moments, now all we have left is to confront them.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,700
I know, I have to be strong.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,340
Strong, weak. It's fine to be vulnerable too.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,740
Thank you.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how, but you always have perfect timing.
