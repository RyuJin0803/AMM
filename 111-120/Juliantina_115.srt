00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:02,065
Can I make a comment?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,080
It's a bit early to be drinking, right?

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,440
I don't...

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,780
I don't know if it's the best thing to drink alcohol to cope, it could become a bigger problem, you know.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,120
I don't know what to do.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,580
Be strong.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,600
Look, it seems like you can lean on your friends or...

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,400
If you have a special girlfriend, too...

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,340
Turn around.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,780
Leave this here and I'm going to ask you to tilt that bottle a little.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,320
- More? it will spill.
-Yes, yes.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,040
No, don't worry.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,460
That's it.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,820
Thats good. There you go.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,260
That's it.

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,560
Thank you.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,900
I don't have to hide.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,700
Close your eyes.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:00:00,000
Close them.
