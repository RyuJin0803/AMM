1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:01,855
May I come in?

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:06,965
Vale, I brought you some juice.
Do you want?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,280
Well, I'll leave it here.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,060
Little sister. I don't like seeing you like this, I'm worried about you.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm going to read you something.
Look.

6
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,325
Servando Armenta, the leader of the Armenta's cartel

7
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:27,325
is dead.

8
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:29,425
Do you realize?

9
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,115
With his death, the cartel is completely gone.

10
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:35,585
Nobody is going to hurt you anymore.

11
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:38,265
Little sister,

12
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:40,855
In this house you're fine, you're safe.

13
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:41,855
We're going to take care of you.

14
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:48,705
They are there whenever I close my eyes. I swear...

15
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,645
And I hear the gunshots, and...

16
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:56,825
Don't say that.

17
00:01:00,125 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you want us to call Camilo?
