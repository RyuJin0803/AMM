1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,640
Look, Juliana.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,260
Don't you think that if we had a long conversation, you could realize--

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,500
I mean, I would love to tell you that I'm your father.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,840
But I'm not Chino Valdes.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,120
I only want to know what you were doing in the Carvajal's house.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,400
What? Did the narcos sent you?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,020
- Who do you have to kill?
- I don't have to kill anyone.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,120
I am not your father.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,580
I was defending that family, that's all.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,500
- Why?
- Because I'm a human being and if you see someone about to kill a person

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,620
Evidently, it's logical that you do something about it.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,600
You are Chino Valdes' daughter. Do you think that if they sent your father to kill someone

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,960
That's how he would have done it?

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,980
Wouldn't he have known how to escape? Would he have taken so long? For God sake!

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,000
Look, why don't you just speak clearly at once?

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,780
Are you or are you not my father?

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,600
I know this is complicated!

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,720
Hey, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,740
I need you to try and understand me.

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,300
And not to tell a word about this, that's all.

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,940
I assure you that I'm going to explain everything to you.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,540
I need you to pay attention.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,260
Juliana.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm sorry, Miss, but you can't be here.

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,180
- The patient needs to rest.
- Wait a minute, I'm talking to her! She'll leave after.

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,380
- Please.
- Please, get out.

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,320
- Juliana!
- Relax.

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
- Relax.
- Juliana!

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,620
- Lay back, stay calm.
- Juliana!

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey!
- Calm down.
