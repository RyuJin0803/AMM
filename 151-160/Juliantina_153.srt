00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,020
- Miss, how are you?
- Good morning.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,180
Good morning. I came here yesterday, remember?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,420
Um... Well, I gave you the wrong name of my father.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,600
I gave you his nickname because-- I don't know, nobody calls him by his name.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,280
And... And I messed it up, so...

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,920
- I wanted to know if you could search by his real name.
- Let's see, tell me his name.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,720
It's um... Jacobo Reyes.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,760
Indeed, he is here.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,780
But I can't give you more information.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,860
- Why?
- It's not allowed.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you anything else.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
Oh, Miss, please. You see, he is my father.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,420
Okay? And he's--

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,140
Nobody could find him, my mom is so worried. Please, I beg you.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,280
- I only want to see him, make sure he's alright.
- Okay, okay, okay.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,880
But I'll ask you to please not take too long.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,640
- No, no, I won't.
- Right. He's in room 102.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,340
- 102. Okay.
- Right this way.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,720
- Thank you so much. I won't take long.
- Don't take too long.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.
