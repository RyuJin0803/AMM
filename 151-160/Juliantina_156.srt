1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Juliana, I'm not who you believe I am.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,820
I assure you I know perfectly who you are.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,800
You are a liar.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,620
When are you going to stop lying?

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,240
You hurt someone

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
- Who I really care about.
- I ask you to give me the opportunity to explain to you what's going on.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,500
- It's weird but if you--
- Sure, what are you going--? What?

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,880
You want to do to me what you did to my mom, right? See if I could be fooled too.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,500
What are you going to tell me to convince me?

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,440
I want to tell you that I'm not your father.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,560
I mean, I'm not Chino Valdes. I'm a businessman. A 60 year old man,

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,160
With a family, with a past,

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
With another face, with another life, that unfortunately transmigrated or reincarnated,

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,380
However you want to call it, in the body of your father, Chino Valdes.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,780
Just like

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,880
- Magic?
- I don't know if it was magic or what it was. I don't know!

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,580
I know that your father died in the electric chair at the same time I did!

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,460
And unfortunately I inherited everything! I mean, all the bad things! I got them all!

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,540
Okay, so--

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
What about the hurricane?

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,220
You didn't notice anything wrong during the hurricane?

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,500
I mean, beyond the physical appearance, didn't you feel that I was another person? Didn't--?

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,920
No, I can't believe

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,980
That you'll keep lying like that.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
No, I can't believe it.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
You're a liar.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:00:00,000
You have always been a liar.
