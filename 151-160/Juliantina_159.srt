1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
My daughter, how did it go?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,120
I'll go see what happened.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,020
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,520
How did it go with Valentina?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,700
I didn't go to see Valentina.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,620
I went to see my dad at the hospital.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,820
He says his name is Jacobo.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,540
You're so stubborn Juliana, stop.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,220
No, mom.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,460
You know, he lied to my face again.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,540
Look.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,300
I was his woman.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,340
I've known him intimately in the worst moments and..

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,260
I'm telling you, the man in the hospital is not him.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,440
A person can't change so much in so little time.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Look, mom..

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
That's what criminals do.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,460
That same thing again.

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,920
The same thing again?

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm gonna tell you something.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,580
If you want to believe his stories about souls and stuff, then that's your problem.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm not going to be convinced.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,220
Okay?

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,160
If you want to be fooled, that's your problem.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't do that to me.
