1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,205
- They told me you had a bad night.

2
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:20,035
I want to offer you an apology, personally.

3
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,295
- You don't have to apologize. It wasn't your fault.

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,805
- Yes.
- No, you couldn't have known

5
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,665
That guy was going to become obsessed with you.

6
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,395
- But Iâ€™m responsible.

7
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:37,625
There's something I need to discuss with you.

8
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:40,975
It's about your friend Juliana.

9
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:43,455
- What about Juliana?

10
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,435
- Did you know she's Jacobo's daughter?

11
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:57,735
- Sorry, I didn't understand. What?

12
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:59,455
- Jacobo, the driver.

13
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:02,075
He's Juliana's, your friend's, dad.

14
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,155
- No.

15
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:09,505
- I imagine you didn't know, due to your reaction.

16
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,265
- It's just, it can't be.

17
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:14,855
I mean,

18
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:17,135
I don't know who lied to you, but, no.

19
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,875
- What did she tell you about her dad?

20
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:24,305
- Nothing.

21
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,135
Nothing good, honestly.

22
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:30,805
I mean, she hasn't seen him for a long time

23
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:32,045
And, besides,

24
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,095
He's a very bad person, as far as I know.

25
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,445
- I don't understand.

26
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:41,485
If she claims to be your friend, why did she lie to you?

27
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:45,405
- It's just, I don't know where you're getting your information but it can't be true,

28
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,405
Okay?

29
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,405
- Okay...

30
00:01:50,225 --> 00:00:00,000
- You're really confusing me.
