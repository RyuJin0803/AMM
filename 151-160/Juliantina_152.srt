00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,160
Hey.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,580
Val, what's up? You finally answer me.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,460
I was so worried about you.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,300
Did you hear about what happened?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,660
Yes. When we were talking,

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,380
Well, when I called you,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,720
The call was still going and I saw that they were threatening you.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,100
I rushed to your house but the police didn't let me in.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,600
I had no idea you had been here.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,720
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,200
But I heard that everyone was all right, your family and all.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,240
And I knew they wouldn't let me in, so

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,660
I came back home. But you have no idea how relived I am to know that you're okay.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,680
- How do you feel? 
- I still can't believe that I got out of it alive.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,580
I don't-- I don't know.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,720
Val, I get it.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
I imagine it was all really hard.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,680
Do you want me to go to your house tomorrow?

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,220
I think it's better if I let you know when I feel better, because like--

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,380
Not yet.

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not in the mood to do anything.
