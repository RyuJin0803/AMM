00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Chivis, it's to be expected that Vale doesn't want to get out of her room.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,940
After all what happened yesterday?

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,560
My dear Eva,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,940
My girl Valentina is in a really bad state.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,460
- She doesn't want to eat.
- I know, the poor thing is in shock.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,040
Why don't you give her some pills? Mmm?

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,740
So she can sleep and she'll feel better tomorrow.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,300
Yes, yes.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,060
No, no, no, no, no!

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,740
No!

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,760
No!

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,800
No!

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,880
No!

14
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,420
If they want blood, I'll give them the blood of the princess.

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
You two calm down. Calm down.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,220
Right?

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,220
No...!

18
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,680
- Valentina, what's happening?
- I can't do it.

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,080
Val, are you all right?

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,400
What is it?

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm scared, Eva, I'm so scared.

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,140
I'm afraid that they'll come back.

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,400
And what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do if they come back?

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:00:00,000
What are we gonna do?
