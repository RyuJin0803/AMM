1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,460
How are you?

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,780
Good.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,720
You?

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,420
Good.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm so glad to see you.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,920
Here, sit.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,260
What happened at the house was..

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,980
Very intense honestly, but...

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,820
I don't want to talk about that.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,760
I asked you here for another reason.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm going to ask you a question.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,740
And I want you to be really honest with me.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,060
Okay?

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,560
Is Jacobo your dad?

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Yes.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,960
I can't believe you lied to me like that. I thought...

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,540
No.
I thought we could trust each other.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,040
Were you lying the whole time?
No, no, no, look, Val.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,820
You did.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,260
No, I didn't know that my dad worked here.

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,620
How did you not know your dad worked here?

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,360
Val, I've never seen him here.

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,100
The first time I saw him here was after the kidnapping.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,060
When the police brought him out, when they put him in the ambulance.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Val, I never lied to you.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have a reason to lie. I've never lied to you.
