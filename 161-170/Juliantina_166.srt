1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Don't pressure her.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,500
Nobody is pressuring her.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,120
Just that, this was already too much, Camilo.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,540
Valentina has been depressed and doing silly things for a long time.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,960
I think you should medicate her.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,600
Eva, listen. She needs family protection.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,020
Family support.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,440
Valentina is always surrounded by people.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,680
There are always lots of people in the house.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,140
Yes, there are always people in the house.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,560
I remember perfectly, this house is always full.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,360
But, who's listening to her?

13
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,280
No one.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,240
It's like your father. Do not make the same mistake your father did.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,860
Did he listen? No, he listened to absolutely no one.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,420
And that is what you should not do. Understand?

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,180
How are you?

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm very good, thank you.

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,400
Yes?
Yes.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,440
You know, my house is always open to you, when you want to talk.

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,760
Yes, thank you so much, Camilo.
I will come see you when I can.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,680
You will?
Yes.

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,460
Listen to Valentina, okay?

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
