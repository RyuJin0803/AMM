1
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:01,165
- What are you doing here?

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:04,575
- Why do you care?

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,665
- You've got nothing to do here.
- Look, I'm already going.

4
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:10,465
But not because you asked me to but because it's best.

5
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:12,705
So they don't see us fighting.

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:18,825
- Vale,

7
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,055
are you okay?

8
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:23,485
Take this, I brought you water.

9
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,475
- I don't want it--
- Valentina...

10
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:26,855
- Eva, don't...

11
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,665
- I brought you some painkillers, you're going to take them.

12
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:32,365
- I'm not going to take any painkillers.
- Come on, you're very upset.
- I'm not upset!

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
- Give me your hand.
- Stop, Eva!

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
- I've thought about it.

15
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,645
I'm going to report El Chino.

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,515
- What are you saying?

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,200
- He's a criminal.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
He can't be free, with another identity, 
and go unnoticed.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,545
- Well, on the radio they're saying he's the one who saved

20
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,815
The Carvajal family by killing that narc.

21
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:00,995
- Ah! And you believe it? Really?

22
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,194
Come on, El Chino is a liar, eh?

23
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,745
He convinced you that he's another man. I mean...

24
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,035
- Juliana, please.

25
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,775
Don't report him to the police.

26
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,425
Wait until you find out a bit more about him.

27
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,885
- What else do you want me to find out?

28
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:20,585
I don't understand why you keep defending that man. What's up?

29
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,105
Are you still in love with that trash?

30
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:25,935
After all the things he's done to you?

31
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:28,245
Come on,

32
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,065
I'm not like you.

33
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,055
- Please...

34
00:01:34,135 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't do it.
