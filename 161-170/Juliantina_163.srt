1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
No, everything I'm telling you, I saw it on the news.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,059
Poor Valentina, dude.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,020
Imagine..

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,260
They come into your house and hold you hostage.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,300
Do you really not want to know how she is?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,940
If she's okay or want to see her?

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,400
And why me?

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,540
I don't matter to her, let her girl go see her.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,640
Dude, grow up. What are you, 2?

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,560
Stop with that, no? You made everyone turned their back on her.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,200
Even Claudio and PiÃ±a who are also gays. 
What is that?

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,540
They supported me because they wanted to. I didn't pull a gun on them.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,900
Well, let me tell you, they looked stupid with their homophobic comments. You need to stop.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,320
- Look, Sergio, I'm not homophobic.
- It doesn't look like...

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,160
But, Valentina wasn't fair with me. She wasn't honest and she deserved a little bullying, that's it.

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,120
Let me tell you that she has suffered enough, okay?

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,480
And now with this, a lot more.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
Imagine narcos coming into your house.

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,140
Don't you feel sorry for her at all?
Look.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm really happy to know she is fine, but that's it.

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,020
I don't want to see her again.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,920
She has someone to comfort her, she doesn't need me.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,300
But no, she doesn't have anyone to comfort her. If you're talking about Juliana, they're over.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,820
I spoke to her not long ago and she said they have broken up. She wants to leave the country with her mom.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:00:00,000
Get with it, okay!
