00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,400
Thank you, Chivis.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
Here, my love.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,220
When I was mugged in New York, I took pills for like 2 months.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm telling you this..

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,220
I'm telling you so you know that after a little while, you won't get scared and you won't even remember it.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,220
You know what is super helpful?

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,060
What?
Company.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,620
If you want, I can come by after work...

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,740
Make you some dinner,

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,360
We can watch a movie..

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,320
Really, that isn't necessary, but thank you.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,160
Well..

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,980
I know it isn't necessary, besides, it’s not a problem.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,660
I've missed you a lot.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,020
I love being here, hanging out with you.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,140
With both of you.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,840
I do think that you should organize something.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,860
I don't want to do anything, to be honest.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,200
To distract yourself for a while.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,000
Why not...

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,260
A dinner, with Lucas?

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,720
It's..

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,380
Her boyfriend.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
What Lucas?

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,680
Lucas, Lucas?

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,560
Lucas. Do you remember Lucas?

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,620
How funny. I’m glad that you are finally together.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
Yes.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,720
If you want, I will ask Lucas and we can plan something fun.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
