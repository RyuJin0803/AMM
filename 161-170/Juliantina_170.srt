1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,265
Val, I thought that I would never see him again.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,900
It makes no sense...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,180
It doesn’t make any sense because you said the person who is your dad, is a hitman, okay?

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,940
And Jacobo...

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,020
Is a beautiful person who works in this house and saved my life.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,320
Who.. Who talks to me.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
It has nothing to do – no, you know what, I don’t know what to believe.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,660
- You better leave, Juliana.
- No, you have to listen to me, Val.

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:26,775
I’ll leave later if you want me to. Listen.

10
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,215
I went to look for my dad at the hospital

11
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,105
To ask him what he has been doing here.

12
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,615
You know what he said to me?

13
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,765
That he's not my dad.

14
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,205
Seriously...

15
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:42,440
- I know.
- What is that supposed to mean?

16
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:44,035
I dont understand.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
- You would understand that.
- Yes.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,780
It doesn’t make any sense.

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,940
I dont know how to explain this to you.

20
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:51,555
He told me that

21
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:53,685
He is someone who died and

22
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:55,325
And that he woke up on my dad’s body.

23
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,365
No...

24
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:02,575
I already know that it's crazy.

25
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,865
I don't believe it either.

26
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,455
The problem is that my mom does.

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,125
My mom believes that Jacobo is not El Chino.

28
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,055
What do you think?

29
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:19,705
I think...

30
00:01:21,045 --> 00:00:00,000
There is someone we should see.
