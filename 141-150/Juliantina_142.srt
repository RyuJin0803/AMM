1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Servando!

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,800
Servando, we're losing! They're coming in.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
- Why don't you just kill them--?
- Shut up!

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,920
I've already told you that I'm not going to leave this place before I finish what I came here to do.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,100
Isn't that right, honey?

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
What are you waiting? Go! That's what I pay you for!

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,340
- Go!
- Let's go!

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,780
- Come here, princess.
- No. No, Servando!

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,140
- Shut up!
- No, no, no.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,960
I promise you I'll do whatever you want me to.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,240
If what they want is blood, I'll give them the blood of the princess.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
You two calm down. Calm down.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,120
Armenta!

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,100
Look at that! The super driver.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,720
Are they paying you overtime to be a ridiculous imbecile?

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
How much are you worth?

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,320
- How much are you worth?!
- Let her go or I'll kill him!

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,560
Let her go!

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,580
What are you thinking, pal? I have 30 more of those.

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,540
Be careful! Valentina!

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Servando, the police!

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,660
Freeze! Get on the ground, drop the gun!

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
To the ground!

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,240
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
Oh, no, no, no! Call an ambulance!

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
A phone, please.

27
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,900
An ambulance, please, somebody call one!

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, a phone.
