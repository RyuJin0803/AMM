1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Everything is over. I'm here to take care of you. You're not alone.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Guille!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,660
- Are you okay?
- Yes... I'm okay. I thought I wouldn't see you guys again.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,460
Don't say that.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,420
The most important thing is that you're okay.

6
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,040
I wish it had been me instead, to go through all of that.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,240
It's over.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,220
It's over.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,180
Finally Servando Armenta's obsession for Lucia

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,100
Ended up being his own downfall.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,360
You don't know how glad I am that it's over.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,320
And this must be a big blow to the organization?

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,460
Well, yes. With the leader being dead and the other one in jail,

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,960
Surely, they will disarticulate, but

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,620
They will quickly re-organize.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
It always happens in this country.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,660
That's why we don't let our guard down, Mateo.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,600
But certainly this is a victory.

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thank you all. See you.
- Thank you.
