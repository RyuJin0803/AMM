1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If it hadn't been for Jacobo I wouldn't be here.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,860
Val, it's all so shocking, what you're telling us.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,440
Please, don't think about that anymore. It's over, little sis.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,220
- It's over.
- But it's just--

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
What happens if they-- If they come back?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,100
- No, no.
- It could happen and--

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,500
- Valentina, nobody is coming back.
- They'll come for revenge.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,460
No! Listen to me.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,000
- Guille, we are alone in this house.
- No, Valentina, listen to me.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,580
There are security guards in the house.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,940
For now, you need to get rest.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,480
Do you hear me?

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,660
Why don't you call Juliana?

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,280
That way you can distract yourself a little, watch some movies, talk.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,700
You can disconnect from all of this.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,060
Whatever you want.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,440
We're not together anymore.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,420
What happened?

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,540
Tell us.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,360
The thing is I'm more alone than ever, to be honest.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,300
Hey... Val.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,300
I want you to know

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,960
That from now on you've got a friend in me, okay?

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,860
Call me

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,380
And I'll come here to be with you.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,080
Truly.

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I liked her.
