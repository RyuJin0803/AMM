1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Valentina, come.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,080
Okay, take everyone to the station.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,800
The guards too. Get the testimonies from all of them.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,880
Detective, where is the ambulance?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,620
Calm down, it's on its way.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,460
It's taking too long.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,060
What happened in here, Lucia?

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,360
Servando came back.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,280
He held us hostage for hours, he was about to kill Valentina. If it wasn't for Jacobo,

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,180
We would be dead.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,700
You killed... Servando Armenta?

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,740
Jacobo.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,820
- Can't the ambulance come quicker?
- Calm down, it's coming.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,220
Jacobo, you killed Servando Armenta?

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,100
- Apply more pressure.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,240
Mateo, what else has happened?

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,020
I don't know yet, I'm about to go into the house. As soon as I'm in there, I'll tell you everything.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,280
- The police is already here.
- Tell them I'm coming there right now.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,980
Hey, Miss, where are you going?

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
- You can't go in there.
- I'm a friend of Valentina's.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,120
- Step back.
- Listen to me, please. I need to know how Valentina is.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,580
Please, Gutierrez!

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,280
- You can't pass, it's not safe.
- Well, tell me how she is then. Is everything okay? What happened?

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,380
- Miss, you can't come in. Step back.
- All right. Okay, okay. Fine.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,540
Can one of the paramedics help me out, please?

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,040
Don't look over there. She's having a panic attack. Please, help her.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,340
- Are you okay?
- Yes. And you, ma'am?

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:00:00,000
- Breathe.
- I'm-- I'm calm.
