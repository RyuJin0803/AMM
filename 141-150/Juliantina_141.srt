1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Eva.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,620
We don't know anything yet.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,120
Are those gun shots?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,180
Yes, yes, yes! The narcs and the police are shooting.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,580
They are all inside your house.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,820
Please, tell them not to shoot, they could hurt someone.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,700
Yes, yes, we know that! We know! But there's nothing we can do.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,560
What do you know about Valentina?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,460
I don't know anything Eva. I'll call you later.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Hey, be careful! Come here, come here!

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,960
- Careful! Come here! Cover yourself, cover yourself!
- What's happening?! What's happening?!

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,880
The narcs are in the house, we don't know what's going on.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,640
- Stay covered, stay covered!
- No, no, no!

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,860
How? How?

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm telling you, she's been acting weird for a while and never explains anything.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,740
Did she say where she was going?

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,440
No, she didn't say it. She was in such a hurry and she's taking too long.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,100
Look, relax, Lupita. She probably went out to see her boyfriend.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,880
You'll see she'll be back soon.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,400
Something tells me my daughter is in danger.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,980
Valentina is in there.

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,880
- No, no, we don't know that. 
- No, no! I'm telling you! Listen to me, listen to me!

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,380
I was talking to her just now, and I saw her. I swear! I saw her, she's in there! And there are two other people.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,480
She's being kept hostage, but there isn't much we can do, calm down! There's nothing we can do.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,300
Stay covered! Be careful.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,260
Valentina will be okay.

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,900
Oh, no!

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,240
- No!
- Back me up, back me up!

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,500
What is this girl doing here?

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here?!
