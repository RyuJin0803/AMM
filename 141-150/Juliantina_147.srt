1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,820
Chino's daughter was there and she saw me.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,140
- No.
- Yes, she saw when I went out. In fact, she was calling my name.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,740
I mean, can you imagine if Valentina finds out about this? I'm screwed, Camilo.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,960
- Here, I need you to write the date of your arrival and exit, please.
- Miss?

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,020
Yes, tell me.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,040
- How can I find an injured man who was carried by an ambulance?
- Let's see. Name?

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,400
Macario Valdes.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,460
There is no information from the Red Cross.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,280
So what can I do?

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,780
Well, go check the Secretary of Health's database, it should be there.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,940
Thank you.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,600
I can't find my glasses. Do you know where they are?

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,020
No.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,460
- Come, come. I can introduce you to Lucia.
- Right now?

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,040
- But it's not a good time.
- Yes, I know, but--

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,520
Lucia?

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,440
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,280
Whatâ€™s going on, honey?

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,140
You look pale.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,380
There was a shooting at Valentina's house.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,080
- How is Valentina?
- No, no, no, Valentina is fine.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,900
Her family is fine, but something worse happened.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,620
Well, tell me. You're scaring me.

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,560
My father was there.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Chino Valdes was there and I'm sure he had something to do with it.
