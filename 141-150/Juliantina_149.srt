1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
That's not possible.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,440
What do you mean it's not possible?  I'm telling you, I saw him.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,260
I saw when they got him out of Valentina's house and into the ambulance.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,480
Ambulance?

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,680
I don't know, something happened to him. But it wasn't that bad because he was walking.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,420
Still, I went to all of the hospitals looking for him, but I couldn't find him.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
- Hey, you need to calm down.
- No, mom. How am I going to calm down?

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,020
He could've killed Valentina.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,340
Juliana, listen to me carefully.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,600
You couldn't find your father at the hospitals

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,840
Because Chino Valdes doesn't exist.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,040
What?!

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm telling you that I saw him.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,580
No.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,540
The man you saw works as a driver at Valentina's house.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not your father.
