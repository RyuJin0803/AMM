1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,360
I don't know.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,440
- Sir, stop. You can't come in, it's not safe.
- I'm the owner of this house. Excuse me.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm sorry, Mr Corona. I didn't recognize you at first.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,640
- Thank you, thank you.
- No, no, wait. Wait, sir. Sir!

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,560
Sir!

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,420
I'm Valentina's friend, please let me in. Please.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,440
- We're going to get you onto the stretcher.
- That won't be necessary.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,760
- It's for your own good.
- I'm telling you, there's no need. I'm fine.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,180
- Jacobo, please, don't be stubborn. Let them get you on the stretcher.
- I'm fine, okay?

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,060
Sorry.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,300
You need to come with us to the ambulance, Sir.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,560
Thank you.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,020
Are you okay?

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,400
- Eh-- Are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,000
That's good.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,320
Thank you.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,120
We were going to shoot, but we didn't dare, because they had Miss Valentina.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,560
They came in and threatened us, took our weapons and that's when they came inside.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,900
You were there, right, Tiberio?

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,880
Yes, when I heard the shooting, I looked over and I saw a lot of armed men.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,940
I was very scared. The first thing I did was trying to talk to my wife so she would warn the Mrs.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:00:00,000
But as I dialed, they surprised me and I couldn't talk to them. I thought they were going to kill me.
