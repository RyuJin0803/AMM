1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,460
Drink it.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,640
And try to calm down.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,280
Send your men.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,840
Let them do what they need to do.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
If Armenta wants to kill Lucia, I don't care.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,040
But Valentina needs get out of there safe and sound.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,860
- What you're saying doesn't make sense.
- Oh, no?

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,080
So what? I'm supposed to let them do whatever they want to my sister?

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,700
Calm down.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,740
You're not thinking straight.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,840
In a confrontation like this

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,440
I can't guarantee anyone's life, not even your sister's.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,660
Besides,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Think.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,880
What will the police think? And your moron husband?

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,120
But it's you that--

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,480
That the Sierra's Cartel protects your family. That's what you want them to think?

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,500
Besides!

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,600
From there until they find out about our business is one step away.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,300
So what? I'll just sit here with my arms crossed,

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,160
While they do something to my sister? No!

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
I have to do something.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,160
You're not going anywhere.

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,200
There is nothing you can do there.

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,300
You're safe here.

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
Is that clear?

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,400
I don't want anyone to interrupt me while I'm in the room with Lucia.

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,280
Stop with the games, Servando. We have to get out of here!

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm the one who gives the orders here!

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Understand it!

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,140
No!

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,180
No, not her. Not her!

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,700
Quickly!

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,020
Five minutes.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,180
Give me five minutes.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,320
What's happening?

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:00:00,000
- What's happening?
- It's okay, just relax.
