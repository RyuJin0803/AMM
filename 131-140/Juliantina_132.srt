00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,260
Lower it. (window)

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,700
Lower.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,380
Hello.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,580
Whats up?

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,380
So what, Servando, what do we do now?

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,920
Pay attention.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,620
Relax, my girl. Nothing will happen to you if you behave well.

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,320
Honk, so they come out.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,560
But, honk!

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,120
Lets go guys. Vans are coming, two come with me, two go north.

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,420
Sir, get me some policemen.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,300
Where are the police?

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,480
Open the door!

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,520
We bring you the princess of the house.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,520
Mrs Lucia Borges will be very happy to see us.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,720
Silvina, has Valentina not returned yet?

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,980
Silvina, what's wrong?

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,640
Its the guardhouse. They have my child Valentina.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
Who?
The narcos, the narcos are outside.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,780
Fabricio?

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,300
Fabricio, please say something.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:00:00,000
