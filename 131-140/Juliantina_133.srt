1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,840
Stop, stop here

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
Fabricio?

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,860
He's not saying anything. What do we do Silvina?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,380
Were you the one who greeted us last time?

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,060
It was me.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Sorry, princess.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,300
Let's go inside.

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,360
Good afternoon, my lady.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,480
Good afternoon, Servando.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
What do you want?

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,080
I want lots of things, but particularly I need your help with a dilemma.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,960
I was thinking on my was here...

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,540
and I couldn't come to a conclusion.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,820
What dilemma?

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,860
I don't know if today I should sleep with you..

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:00:00,000
or with the princess of the house.
