1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Quickly!

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,540
Over there.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,680
Rogelio, go see what that was now, go.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,560
Servando, please they have nothing to do with this. Leave them alone.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,420
You don't get to call the shots, do you hear me?
Its me that you want.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,880
Take me, we will leave.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,920
Lucia, don't do this.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Shut up, sit down. Sit down.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,820
Enough!

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,620
Go with the lady and bring me the best tequila in the house.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,260
Servando, there is shooting out there, the police will be here soon.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,220
Did you not hear me?

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,440
I want you to prepare food.
And bring me the best tequila in this house.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,340
This afternoon is very promising.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Isn't that right, my lady?

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,240
Are you listening? Let's go.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,080
Let's go!

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,220
I'm sorry Valentina, you should not be going through this.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,640
I will do everything to make this okay.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,060
I promise.
I know, I know.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.
