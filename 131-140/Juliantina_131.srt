1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Who were you talking to when I arrived?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,800
With Panchito.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,980
He was telling me what's going on at Milagros's house.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,240
Ahh, poor guy, I can imagine.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,220
Honestly, I feel more comfortable here.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,160
Of course, me too.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,320
Hey ma?

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,320
I was thinking and you're right.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,700
I think... It might be good idea to leave the city,

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,320
or the country.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not going to the USA.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,820
No, I wasn't thinking about the USA.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,640
I was thinking about Costa Rica.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,460
Costa Rica?

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,480
Where is that?

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,820
In Central America.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,860
A friend told me where we could find work and food.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Somewhere to stay.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,420
And when did you change your mind?

20
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,740
No, look ma, I thought about it and you are right.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,800
Being here is really dangerous for us.

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,680
Did something happen and you don't want to tell me?

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,120
Ma..

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,260
Look, nothing has to happen for me to want to protect my family.

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,880
Look.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,220
Look at these photos of Costa Rica.

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, its really cool.
