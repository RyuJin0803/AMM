1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,820
Honey, you haven't eaten anything.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,380
Do you want me to make you something to eat?

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,320
No, mom, thank you.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,080
Can you close the door, please?

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,920
Without a doubt, Leon Carvajal was an interesting man.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Right?

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Yes.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,220
What's up, Val?

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,940
- What is that? Huh?
- What?

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,540
- Give it to me.
- Nothing, I have nothing with me.

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,640
Give it to me!

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,580
I'm sorry. I swear, I didn't even know I had it. Forgive me.

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,200
Val?

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,060
- Uh-huh.
- An accident like this, that could blow up your head?

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,760
- No, no, please!
- Is that what you want?

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,740
Val, what's going on? Who is this?

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,160
Val, what's going on?

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,200
Don't try anything.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,800
Stay there.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,540
Val, what's happening?

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:00:00,000
You want this? Huh?
