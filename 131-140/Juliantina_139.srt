1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,720
Who called you?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,760
Answer me!

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,960
A--

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,920
A friend.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,000
- She called me, but I--
- Your siblings?

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,040
- No, it wasn't them.
- Where are they?

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,540
- I don't know.
- They don't live here.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,180
Only the three of us, so they're not coming.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,260
- You shut up.
- Servando, these woman are playing us.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,140
They're wasting our time. The police is coming, we have to go now, please!

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,380
Boss.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,820
Here's everything we found.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,840
Put it on the table.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,560
Relax, Chulo.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,960
This party is just beginning.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,740
So, you relax.

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,460
Let's go. More tequila, come on!

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,240
Juli, what's wrong?

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,440
- Nothing.
- Juliana?

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:00,000
- No, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
