1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Don't you think you're exaggerating a little, Servando?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,160
It's funny that you're the one making this comment, my lady.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,060
If you're referring to last nights call..

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,900
allow me to offer an apology,

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,440
that wasn't the correct tone to talk to you in.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,080
How people change when they are scared, right Servando?

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,300
Talk to me and we can make an agreement.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,660
Valentina and Silvina have nothing to do with this.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,220
Let us talk like civilised people.

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,940
Who told you that I was a civilised person?

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,180
I can appear to be one, when something interests me.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,080
But when a woman like you snubs me..

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,900
then I lose interest.

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,680
And I become very obsessive.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,720
Please, please don't hurt us!

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,460
Shut up!

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,660
Unless you want to be the second person to say hello to Juanita. (his gun?)

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
Servando, please.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,460
Are you going to kill three women in their own house?

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,460
And look like a coward in front of the whole world?

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we're understanding each other, my lady.
