1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Vale.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,820
Please don't be impulsive.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,900
Think things through.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,980
What are people going to say?

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,300
I don't care what people say.

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,020
Oh really?

7
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,560
Yes.

8
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,540
And did you already tell your friends from school?

9
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,040
What did they tell you?

10
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,720
They don't know, OK? They don't know.

11
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,940
But they're not going to react like you

12
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,660
because they're not close minded like that, Evangelina.

13
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,760
You honestly don't know what you're doing, Vale.

14
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,940
I'm only going to warn you that I'm not going to allow you to insult the house of my parents.

15
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,460
So you tell that girl not to come back,

16
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,320
if you don't want me to put her in her place.

17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
You're not going to put anyone in their place, OK?

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
You don't even have the right --

19
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,300
You know what?

20
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,540
Thank goodness our father isn't here.

21
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,020
Because if not, he'd be really disappointed --

22
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,000
Don't bring dad into this.

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh, no?

24
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,220
No.

25
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,240
And what did you think he was going to do?

26
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,780
Applaud you?

27
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,300
Celebrate the news?

28
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,740
Look, Vale.

29
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,740
You know what? You got me fed up.

30
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,680
I know now that you're infatuated and nothing is going to change your mind.

31
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,100
I only hope that by tomorrow, you don't regret this.

32
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,800
When all your little friends turn their backs on you.

33
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,560
That's not going to happen.

34
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
What is going to happen, is that at the end of everything,

35
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:56,795
The one who's going to end up alone.

36
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,555
Is you.

37
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,800
That's not true, Eva.

38
00:01:08,140 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not true.
