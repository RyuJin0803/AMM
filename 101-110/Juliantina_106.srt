1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Enough.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,440
I can't anymore.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,680
Do you know what she did to me?

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,220
What did she do? What did she do?

5
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,020
She found out I was dating Renata

6
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,640
and she decided she's not my secretary.

7
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,240
She moved her to another department.

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
I did go talk to her, and I asked her nicely

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,160
that she put her back to position.

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,500
And she didn't care.

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,600
What are you going to do?

12
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Quit.

13
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,520
What?

14
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,740
Renata did the same. I mean enough, enough.

15
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,560
We're going to start from zero.

16
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,525
And I thought my life was complicated.

17
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,340
What do you mean complicated?

18
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,260
What happened?

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,260
Lucho caught me and Juliana in the Valle house.

20
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:35,205
And obviously he told Eva.

21
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:36,865
And what did she say?

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,560
I don't know. I have no idea.

23
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,080
Obviously I haven't gone to see her.

24
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,320
It gives me panic.

25
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,080
That's what Eva needs to understand.

26
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,125
That everyone

27
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:48,545
can live their life how they want.

28
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,160
You understand?

29
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,480
And you, Val, need to look into your heart

30
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,200
and need to find what makes you happy.

31
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,220
You shouldn't care about what she thinks --

32
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,520
what the world thinks.

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,880
You understand?

34
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,015
Look, Guille.

35
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,255
Look, I --

36
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,095
I understand, OK?

37
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,935
And I love you, and I support you.

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,800
But you can't leave me like this.

39
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,700
Please, no.

40
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,780
I'm sorry, Val.

41
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,740
It's - It's already decided.

42
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,780
It's not the same without you.

43
00:01:37,945 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.
