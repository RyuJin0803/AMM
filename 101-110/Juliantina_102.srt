00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Valentina had been very weird with me these last days and then, out of nowhere, she broke up with me.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,600
I guessed she was cheating on me but I never imagined it was with a woman.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,520
- No, no, no, that can't--
- I was never that fond of this Juliana girl.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,240
She took advantage of her, of the depression your sister was in, because of her father's death.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,219
So she surely took advantage of it to confuse her.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,660
Valentina is not a lesbian, I can guarantee you!

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,800
You, as her older sister, should get her away from that Juliana,

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,720
Because if this gossip gets out, it will be a mess. And you know what would happen if--

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,320
No, no, Lucho, stop! It's enough.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,240
From now on, I will deal with it. I'll talk to her.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,100
Totally. I'm already used to dealing with all the scandals in my family.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,740
Thank you for coming here to tell me.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,340
I assume that now this stays between you and me.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,540
- Believe me when I say I don't want to tell anyone else.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,740
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of things to do.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,740
Yes.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,600
Sorry for interrupting you. Thanks for allowing me in.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,860
Oh, dear God. It can't be.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,080
Val.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,420
- Val. Val!
- What?

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,620
What?

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,280
You understand why we have to go?

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhm-hmm.
