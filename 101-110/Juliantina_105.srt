1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Vale?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,820
Chivis?

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,160
Yes?

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,220
- Yes, ma'am, I'm here.
- Hi, Chivis, has Valentina arrived?

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,140
- No, not yet.
- Well, when she gets home let me know, okay?

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,960
Yes. Excuse me.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,440
Chivis.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,160
- Yes?
- Shh.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,840
Yes, my girl?

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,660
- Is Eva home? Hi.
- Hi.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,980
Yes, she's in her room.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,060
- She asked me to let her know when you arrived.
- Okay, no, no, no. Don't tell her.

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,900
Guille's here?

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,560
- Yes, he's also in his room.
- Okay.

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,360
- Don't go tell Eva I'm here.
- No.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,440
- Where are you traveling to?
- I'm not going on a travel.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm moving out.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,980
- What?
- Yes.

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,740
I want to live my life the way I want. However I feel like.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,760
And I want to show the entire world that I'm capable of succeeding on my own and--

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,020
No, Guillermo-- Listen.

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,600
- You are really wrong. You can't move out.
- Why am I wrong?

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,480
- Because you can't go. Come on, be logical. What's the matter with you?
- Eva!

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,940
Eva. Eva! She's the problem.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,180
I'm tired of her telling us what we should do.

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:00:00,000
Of her wanting to control us all the time.
