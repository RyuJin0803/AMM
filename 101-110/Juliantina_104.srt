00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,140
Thank you.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
I don't want to be here. I don't--

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,220
I want us to go some place where there's nobody else. That we stay there, that we can disappear.

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,460
That we don't need to come back to this damn--

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,140
Val, hey.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,880
I don't want to be away from you either.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,320
But I don't want to keep hiding.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,080
What?

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,020
Are you afraid to talk to your sister?

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,220
Ugh, I'm--

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,680
This is getting too intense, to be honest.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
- Val.
- What?

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Hey,

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,280
- We knew it was going to be like this.
- Yeah, but I thought we were going to have more time, okay?

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,560
That I was going to be more prepared. That--

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,240
Hey, relax! Listen to me.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,380
When you're with your sister, remember the pact.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,800
Everything's going to be okay.

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,960
Calm down.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,180
No, I know, but it's just too much.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,420
I can't take it anymore.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
What happened, honey?

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Weren't you going to spend the whole day with Valentina?

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,020
We came back earlier.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,740
Juliana, what's wrong? Are you okay?

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,020
Nothing, I'm fine.

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,320
Give her some space.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll pass.
