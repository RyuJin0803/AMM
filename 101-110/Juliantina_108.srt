1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,660
Listen to me.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,640
Look.

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,800
I know that the death of our dad affected you.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,220
It hurt all of us.

5
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:08,645
And it hurts everyone differently.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,140
That's why I know that this confusion that you're having,

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,200
these feelings that you think you have,

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,220
for this girl,

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,860
is only a product of the depression that you're living.

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,660
This has nothing to do with any depression.

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,320
I like Juliana.

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,380
I'm in love with Juliana.

13
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,560
I'm in love with her.

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,140
I can't believe what's happening to me.

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,880
It's cause this isn't happening to you.

16
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,200
It's happening to me, Eva.

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
But you are my sister and you are a Carvajal!

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,620
And I'm not going to give you permission to have this relationship.

19
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,900
So, tell that Juliana,

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,420
that she can't come to this house,

21
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,445
nor the Valle house,

22
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:39,820
nor any property of the family.

23
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,860
Do you understand?

24
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,280
Answer me! Do you understand?

25
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
You being the older sister

26
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,120
doesn't give you the right

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,180
to tell me what to do.

28
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,360
Not me, nor Guille, OK?

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,900
Do you not realize what's happening?

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,420
Guille left the company. He left the house.

31
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,920
You want me to leave too?

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,140
You're going to end up alone, Eva.

33
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,980
Alone, Eva.

34
00:01:01,980 --> 00:00:00,000
- You're going to end up alone.
- Vale.
