1
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,060
Come in.

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,860
I'm here. What do you want?

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,960
Lucho came to see me at my office.

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,240
And he told me something I hope isn't true.

5
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,485
Well, I don't know what he told you, but yes either way.

6
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,495
Valentina, are you crazy?

7
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,645
You don't like women.

8
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,555
No.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,140
I like Juliana.

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,360
Vale.

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,480
Don't say those things.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,120
You've had boyfriends all your life.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,560
I've known you forever.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,360
You are not homosexual.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,980
Also, where did Juliana come from?

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,020
Who introduced you to her?

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,520
What does that have to do with this?

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,940
Because I'm sure she got close to you because of your interest.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,000
That is not true, OK?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
And you haven't even tried with her.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,060
You have no reason to say something like that.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,120
Val, it's because you are so naive.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,180
I'm naive? I'm naive?

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:00:00,000
No!
