00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,060
Hey.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,520
What's up?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,840
What's up, why are you here?

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,520
Well, I went to your house and your mom said you'd be here.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,360
That's why I came.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,800
Don't think I'm stalking you.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,340
No. I didn't say that.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,980
Okay.

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,120
Well, I came because I have news about Costa Rica.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,960
Oh really?

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,780
Yes, I talked to someone who said he could give you work..

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,460
And also a place where to live.

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,380
Cool.
It's all solved.

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,580
That's so cool.
Yeah?

15
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,920
Let's go eat and I'll tell you how it's there and so on.

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,900
I can't, I'm working right now but...

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,980
Yes, go. Go eat with your friend.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,920
You can relax and you can work tomorrow. Yes?

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,300
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,280
Take advantage it because I don't have classes today and I'm not free all the time.

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,940
Okay then. I'll go get my things and I'll come.
Go, go. Okay.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,080
Thank you, Perlita.

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,700
Thank you.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,220
If something happens to her...

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,720
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take care of her, don't worry.

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Like the girl of your eyes.
