00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,940
Barreto is preparing a defense to prove that my brother had no idea of what was going to happen at the liquor store.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,080
They want to prove that ToÃ±o lead him into it.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,460
ToÃ±o has always been the type of guy who gets into trouble

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,780
And it was obvious that sooner or later he would get caught.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,880
I just want Guille to be out of there as soon as possible. You know, because I-

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,800
I couldn't even sleep last night thinking about how he spent the night.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,900
Calm down, he'll be fine.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
It's okay.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,420
My family is falling apart, Lucho.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,900
I was thinking about that earlier.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
I heard on the radio that...

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,220
Last night, your dad's body was stolen. Is that true?

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,200
I don't understand what's happening anymore.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,060
Calm down.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,580
Everything will be okay.

16
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,540
Juliana.

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,160
Juliana, wait.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!
