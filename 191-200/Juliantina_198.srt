1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,180
Come in.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,360
You can stay here, in peace, until you leave for Costa Rica.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,600
This is huge.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,920
I don't know if I'll be able to pay you.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,640
Hey, no one is asking you to.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,560
It's important to give,

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,660
As it is to learn to receive. Okay?

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,540
That's what friends do.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,620
And to celebrate that you have a new home,

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,400
I brought you this magic.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,620
This mezcal is amazing. Lucho's family makes it.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,920
Lucho is your best friend?

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,020
That dude...

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,400
He's a karma.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,000
He's like a dog you love, but he keeps pissing on your rug and

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,400
Then you don't want him.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,620
Look...

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,140
Lucho is a good guy.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,380
What happens is that

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,200
He throws tantrums and things at home are rough, that's why he's like that.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,440
If you'd known him before dating Valentina...

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,400
He was worse.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,440
He's gotten better.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,720
I ran into him at Valentina's house.

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,380
Really?

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,780
I thought they weren't talking anymore.

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,540
They were hugging.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
Really?

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,660
Do you think they might make up?

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,840
I wouldn't know what to tell you.

31
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,120
With those two, I don't know what to expect.

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,800
They break up and make up, break up and make up.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
They've been like that forever.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
She manipulates him, he manipulates her.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,260
They have a weird game going on.

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be surprise if one day you hear that they're back together again.
