1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Poor Guille, I can't believe this is happening.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,940
What?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,640
How can you say "poor Guille"? You have to be honest, he was looking for this.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,440
Are you serious? That's the best you've got to say right now, Eva?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,880
These are the moments where I miss dad the most.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Are you complaining about me?
No.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm doing everything I can.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm saying that I miss him and that he would know what to do.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,560
Not everything has to do with you, okay?

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,940
Why are you speaking to me in that tone?

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,560
I don't know, because I'm tired and because, I don't know, we're not all like you.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,440
What are you claiming, Vale? I was the first one who rushed to help Guille.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,520
You rushed to help Guille for the family reputation, not because you care about my brother.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,400
How can you say something like that, Valentina?
It's true.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
That's why I can say it.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,900
It's not...
Okay, enough. Stop arguing.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,220
Eva, sit down.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,060
Relax a little.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,740
Guille's girlfriend explained to us what happened, so we're going to let the police and the lawyers do their jobs.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
We don't benefit from looking for someone to blame.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,420
The best thing we can do right now is to get some sleep.

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,320
Besides, Baretto is a very good lawyer.

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,600
Your dad always said so.

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
I'm sorry, Eva.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.
