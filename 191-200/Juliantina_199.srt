1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,860
What am I going to do to get my daughter back?

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,040
Understand her.

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,300
How am I going to do that if I can't even talk to her?

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,740
I went to the restaurant, she told me to leave.

5
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,100
She's angry.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,400
Give her time.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,860
Well, maybe you're right.

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,300
It's just that... I find it hard to understand that my daughter likes another woman.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,320
I don't know. Everything that happens to me is bad, it's like I'm cursed, it's all negative.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Wait, wait. What happened to Juliana is not bad.

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,780
I'm serious.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,240
Oh please, don't start again.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,260
You're always saying the same thing.
No, listen to me, listen to me.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,760
To understand your daughter, the first thing you have to do is open your mind.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,220
Understand that homosexuality is something common.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,840
Everyone has a relative or friend who is homosexual.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,580
Oh yeah, you're so open minded.

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,320
Like who?

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:00:00,000
Like who? I don't know anyone.
