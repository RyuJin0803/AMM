1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
I have no words to thank you enough about what you've done for us.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,600
It's nothing, I love you both a lot.

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,045
You know that you can count on me.

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,360
It's a very difficult situation.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,220
I'm not here to argue.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,040
I don't want to argue, I just want you to come back to the house...

7
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,895
You had a room, here you are sleeping in a cot.

8
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:26,085
I'm not coming back.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,195
- Leave the tantrum.
- No, it's not a tantrum.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,640
You know what have I been thinking?

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,480
That is time I do what I have to do with my life alone, and you start thinking what to do with yours too.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Do you hear yourself?

13
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:42,635
You are being impulsive again.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,460
Just like what happened with Valentina.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,460
So, you keep thinking that... that was an impulse.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,735
- Valentina?
- Of course.
- No, it was not an impulse.

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,580
You didn't even give yourself a chance to have a boyfriend.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,340
You don't know what it is to be with a man, a normal relationship.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,040
Woman-Men. Normal.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Or what?

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,640
Since you were little you like girls?

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,380
I don't know.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,260
I don't know mom, I don't know if I'm gay.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,140
Well then, why did you tangle yourself with Valentina?

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,860
Mom, can you stop saying that I tangled myself with Valentina.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:00:00,000
This is not a tangled thing, don't you understand? I didn't get tangled, I fell in love.
