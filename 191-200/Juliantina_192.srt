1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
She's still not answering my calls.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,840
What if something happened to her?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,020
Nothing happened.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,720
Juliana is mad at you, that's why she's not answering, that's all.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,960
But I'm so worried about where she slept.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
Will you help me look for her?

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,860
Lupita.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,460
Juliana is very smart.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,540
She's gone through difficult things and she knows how to take care of herself.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,780
Calm down.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,140
Yes, you're right.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm not even hungry.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,360
Juliana?

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,420
Mrs Perla, how are you?

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,480
Ah, what a relief.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,060
I was desperate.

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,660
Thank you so much for taking care of my daughter.

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,240
Thank you for calling.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,700
Yes, please.

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,780
She was with Mrs Perla?

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,640
Are you coming with me to the restaurant?

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Look, Juliana is in a safe place.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,140
It's better to give her time to think about things.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,300
Yes, that's true.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
And you..

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,340
You should think about how you're going to deal with her relationship with Valentina.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Because none of this is going to change.
