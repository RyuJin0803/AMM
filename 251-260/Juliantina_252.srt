00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
I have known Lucho since I was three years old.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,060
Do you know what that is?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,140
Our parents were good friends and we've been together forever, I don't know..

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,040
What would all this be,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,980
Without seeing him?

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,600
Juliana?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,280
Juliana, are you okay?

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,340
Yes, yes, yes, I'm perfect.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,300
Jacobo and Beltran got me out of there, it was horrible but..

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,440
But the important thing is that everything is okay now.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,920
Thank God, you're okay.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,200
And you, how are you?

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,860
Bad.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,140
Not good.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,460
They killed Lucho.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,980
What?

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:00,000
They killed him.
