1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,540
Well...

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,780
It's that...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,880
I'm not your angel, I'm...

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm your husband.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,060
What are you saying?

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm Chino ValdÃ©s.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,460
What?

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,840
No. I don't understand anymore.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,140
Every man that comes to this house is your husband?

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,900
I am the only husband she has, you imbecile.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,500
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,220
What?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,540
Are you going to complicate everything or what?

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Tell my mom why you think you are El Chino.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,520
Things from out of this world happened that...

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,900
I still can't understand.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,300
When I was electrocuted, suddenly..

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,340
I appeared in this body and..

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,720
That's all, I have nothing more to explain to you, that's it.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,620
I already told you.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,100
I recognized you.

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,160
I saw it in your eyes.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
And you denied it. You lied to me. You lied to me.
Mom, no, no. Calm down.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,820
Mom, listen.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,320
Stop.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
No, 'stop', nothing!

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,560
Relax, Lupe. I'm here to tell you, okay?

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,340
Dead or alive, Chino has done nothing but ruin our lives.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,700
Hey, Lupe.

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,860
Please.
'Please' nothing!

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,420
What happened to Chino was not God's will.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,440
It wasn't mine either.
It was a curse and he deserved it.

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,500
I don't want to know anything about you.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,300
Not as El Chino.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:00:00,000
Not as an angel.
