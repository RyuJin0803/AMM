00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,740
"You know what? Let's not look for each other anymore, okay?"

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,160
Alirio.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,700
Take me to the office.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Are you okay?

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,600
Mom.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,360
Give me some space, please?

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,660
I want to be alone.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,880
"I'm willing to give up whatever I have to, I will fight anyone."

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,500
"- I don't care if it's my family, my friends, I don't care. So I can be with you.
- No, Val. I'm not."

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,300
"- Oh, no?
- No."

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,360
"- No?
- No!"

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:00:00,000
[SERGIO: How are you? I know things got complicated. Are you up for a cup of coffee and a hug?]
