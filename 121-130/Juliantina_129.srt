1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,320
If Iâ€™m being honest, I didn't think you would come.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,700
Not to offend you but honestly...

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,460
I needed to get out of the house.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,700
I'm not offended, don't worry, I understand.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,020
Hey, do people at your house know about you and Val?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,460
They won't know.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,060
Because?

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,480
Because Val and I broke up.
No way.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Really?

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,800
Really, it was for the best.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,660
Her family would never get it, besides..

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,180
Look at everything that happened at the university.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,440
Yeah..

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,480
Things got messed up but hey, people forget these things quickly so...

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,700
It will all pass with time and space.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,200
I don't think that will happen with Eva Carvajal.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,960
Yes, Val's sister is very intense.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,340
But, you guys are old enough, you can do what you want.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:00:00,000
It's much more complicated than that, Sergio.
