1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,100
[From princess to dyke.]

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,320
Are these people really your friends?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,100
They were my friends.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,360
I also can't believe your sister Eva knocked on my door to tell me to stay away from you.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,460
And to call you an opportunist.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,680
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,740
I really don't know what's happening.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,200
I don't understand.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,580
Val, I don't know if we should continue with this.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,240
With what?

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,600
With us being together.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
What about our pact?

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,100
We were naive, Val.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm willing to give up whatever I have to, I will fight anyone.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,460
- I don't care if it's my family, my friends, I don't care. So I can be with you.
- No, Val. I'm not.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,520
- Oh, no?
- No.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,200
- No?
- No!

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,680
I mean, no. My mom just got out of the hospital.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,820
- The narcs are looking for her.
- What does that have to do with anything?

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,000
- I don't even know how long I will be in this city.
- It doesn't matter!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,239
- It does matter, Val!
- Why are you saying this now?

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,160
- I don't understand why you're saying this.
- Val, I don't know how my mom will react.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,800
- It doesn't matter how your mom will react, Juliana!
- Look, Val!

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,100
Don't you realize how complicated this is getting?

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,240
- I do not care!
- And I don't want to affect your life even more.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,040
My life is already affected, Juliana!

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,860
You know? Let's not--

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's not look for each other anymore, okay?
