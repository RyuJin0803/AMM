1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
My girl?

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,740
You have a visitor.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,080
Excuse me.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,680
What are you doing here? I swear, if you're here because of Lucho--

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,980
Lucho didn't send me, I came here on my own.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,480
To be honest, I didn't like the way they treated you at the University, so

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,240
That's why I'm here.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,580
I have no problem with you and Juliana dating.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,900
On the contrary.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,040
It's cool, I support you.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,780
Really?

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,760
Yes, really.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,000
Swear it.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,620
And, well...

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,720
I also came because

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,880
It was my fault that everyone found out you changed Lucho for Juliana.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,820
How? I mean, Why--? Why would you do something like that?

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,400
I was an idiot! Really, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Don't be mad at me. I was really drunk and

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
It just came out. I told Nayeli and--

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,200
- Oh, Nayeli. Perfect.
- Damn Nayeli told everyone and all of that happened.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,560
Honestly, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,080
I suppose everyone would find out anyway.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,040
Hey.

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,660
I'm on your side.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,380
Whatever you guys need, seriously,

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,380
You can ask me.

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,040
And don't even worry about the people at the University.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
They'll get over it and go back to normal and if not,

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,500
I'll take care of those idiots.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,300
And, well.

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,140
I also wanted to congratulate you for having such good taste, 'cause

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,760
What an upgrade, huh? Going from Lucho to Juliana?

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow!
