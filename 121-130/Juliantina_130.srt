1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,900
So, now I need to get out of the city with my mum.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,420
Why is that?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,660
Because my mum is sick.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
You're right, it is complicated.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,160
And have you thought about where you would go?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,580
I have no idea.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,960
Well if it is any help to you, I spent some time in Costa Rica and it was really, really cool.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,100
I was there for 2 months and when I arrived, they gave me food and work. So?

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,560
Really?
Yes.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,500
But, it is Costa Rica, so I don't know if that is too far?

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, tell me more.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,340
Okay, look..

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,640
I have photos from my trip.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Have a look.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,260
Hey, would it be really hard to find a job there?

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,720
If you want, I can put you in contact with who hired me and I don't think it would be a problem.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,380
We can give it a shot, right.
Yeah?

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,760
When do you want to leave?

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to go as soon as possible.
