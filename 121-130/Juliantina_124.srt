1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,780
- Hey.
- No, wait, wait. Come out here.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,480
What?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,700
What is it?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,520
- What happened?
- Your sister just left.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,080
- Eva?
- Yes.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,340
Why? What-- I mean, what was Eva doing here here?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,140
- What do you think?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,020
To tell me to stay away from you, Val.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,440
Are you serious?

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,280
I can't believe this.

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,040
Honestly, what is happening? Why--

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,720
- Why is everyone against us? I don't get it.
- I don't know. Plus, you didn't see the way she talked to me.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,940
- She didn't even greet me.
- But do something.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,240
- Val!
- Honestly, I-- This makes me very anxious.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,420
Hold on. Wait a second.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,040
Hello.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,000
Juliana, who knocked?

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,400
Valentina, mom, we're gonna hang out for a little while.

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,060
Okay.

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,800
- Val.
- What?

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,560
- We can't talk here.
- Then let's go somewhere else.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,880
Val.

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,240
Val, wait for me?

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,420
Valentina!

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm sorry, but Miss Juliana can't get into the car.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,200
- Excuse me?
- What?

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,180
I have been given orders by Mrs. Eva.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,340
None of the drivers can allow you to get into the family's cars.

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,440
- Are you serious?
- Or any of the properties.

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
- No way.
- Of course.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,160
I mean... No.

32
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,660
Look, Alirio, I've had a very bad day so I'm asking you to, please, get out of the way.

33
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,940
- Please, Miss Valentina, please don't get me into trouble.
- Alirio, what are you doing? Move.

34
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,600
Hey, Valentina! Calm down!

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,880
Don't yell at him. It's not his fault, anyway.

36
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,680
Come on. Let's go.

37
00:01:27,100 --> 00:00:00,000
Val.
