1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Explain to me what your are thinking showing up at Juliana's house to insult her?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,540
Valentina.
In her own house? I don't understand.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,300
Vale, please don't shout we are working, okay?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,640
Are you embarrassed? Well, I am embarrassed that you showed up at her home to insult her.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,420
You are crazy, you really are!
Vale,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,620
Valentina, you can't say this to me while I'm working, you have to leave us alone.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm going to explain because evidently this is all very confusing.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,020
What happened is that my sister doesn't like the fact that I like women.
Valentina, enough, shut up.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,840
Enough Valentina. Stop!

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,060
Mr. Ortis, could you leave us alone?

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,800
Vale, what is wrong with you?

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,700
It's not even that I like women,

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,880
I like one woman.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,560
An incredible woman, who makes me a better person and you're keeping her away from me.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,360
Valentina, I don't care. Listen to me.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,180
You can't come here and shout at my work.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,460
You're confused, you don't know what you're saying, you don't know what you're feeling.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,840
I am not confused!

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,700
Yes you are!
No, I'm not confused.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,540
You are confused. You think you can look at me and tell me what I feel.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,060
Okay, I have had enough of this topic. Enough.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,280
You are not my dad, so leave me alone.
No, I am not your dad, so listen to me carefully,

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,940
The relationship you have with that girl is over!

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,280
Yeah, it really is over.

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,260
You know, now she doesn't want to see me and,

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't blame her because nobody likes it when someone comes to their home to call them a thief.
