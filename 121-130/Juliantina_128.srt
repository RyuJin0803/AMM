1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
Vale, listen to me.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,640
You can't put your neck out on the line for her.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,420
You don't know her, you don't know who she is.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,980
You can't do this.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,420
I know perfectly who she is.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,220
She's the only person who put a smile on my face after my dad died.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
And now thanks to you I don't have her either.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,160
Please don't get like this.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,680
I can't believe you're my sister. 
Come here.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,540
There, there, calm down

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,460
Relax.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,900
You'll see that all of this will pass.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,240
It's temporary, you're just confused.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,260
And you'll see that everything will go back to normal.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,200
I hope you end up alone. Hopefully.

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything that happens after this, Eva, is your responsibility.
