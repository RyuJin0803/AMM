1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,220
Guille?

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,720
How you doing?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,260
I imagined it was you. It's good that it is.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm glad to see you.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,840
How have you been?

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,160
Um... Well, it's questionable, to be honest. It's questionable.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,440
So much has happened since you left.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,860
How are you?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,860
I could be better.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,920
My tires were stolen.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,320
- I can't buy new ones because I don't have a penny.
- Poor thing.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
And I can't find a job.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,660
- I'll buy you new tires, if you want.
- Nah, it's fine.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,420
But it has been a little harder that I thought it would be.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,240
But that's life.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
And you? How are you?

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,560
It has also been a little harder than I thought it would be.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,440
I didn't think the reaction at the university would be like this, to be honest.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,160
They have all taken Lucho's side, so...

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,020
Well, maybe things like these are supposed to happen.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,100
So we can finally live the lives we want to.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,220
It takes a little suffering, right?

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,940
More?

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,540
You know?

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,600
The truth is everything is easier when we're together.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,960
- Please, don't be away.
- I won't be away.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,500
I promise.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,040
Plus, I want you to meet Renata.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's run away, the four of us, please?
