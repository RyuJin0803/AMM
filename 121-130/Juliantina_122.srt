1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,340
- Good morning, Alirio, how are you?
- Good morning, how are you? I'm very good.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,940
I need to talk to you.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,920
Oh, of course, how can I help you?

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,340
Look, I heard that you have been taking Valentina to see her friend Juliana.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Yes, yes.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,180
- I need to ask you a few questions, let's go.
- Of course, ma'am.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,100
The first thing I need to know is...

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,560
- Where are you going, honey?
- To buy some medicines.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,980
I'll be right back.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,320
- Well, I'm going to take a bath.
- Okay.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,560
- Don't take too long, okay?
- No.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,940
It's fine.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,760
- Oh!
- Hello.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,360
Juliana, right?

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,100
Yes, how are you?

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,780
I'm impressed.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,260
First you seduce Valentina,

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,420
Then you come to live here, in my Chivis' house.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,660
What do you want to do next, huh?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,620
To live in my father's house?

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,960
Look.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,680
I know Val is very naive and she sometimes lives in her wonderland world,

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,220
But not me.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm her big sister and I will always be here to protect her from people like you.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Look Eva, I don't have bad intentions. I don't want to take advantage.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,540
What I feel for Valentina is real.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Look, I have nothing against gays.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,520
Seriously. I'm in favor of sexual diversity.

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,640
That they adopt kids, get married, have parades.

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
But all that away from my family.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,880
So I'm going to ask you to stay away from my sister,

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,940
Before you ruin her life.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:00:00,000
Or I will have to ruin yours.
