1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,320
Stop crying, you're going to ruin my good mood.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,800
And, believe me..

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,220
That's not good for anyone.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,820
So let's save ourselves the games and the..

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
'I don't know.'

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,620
'Let me go.'

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,180
Let's get to the point.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Where is your dad?

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,780
I've already told your men, I have no idea where he is.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,720
Listen carefully.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,140
I will settle this debt I have with El Chino

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,660
And collect a lot of interest.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,340
And it's better to work with me.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,140
Believe me.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,440
So tell me, where is your dad?

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,900
Don't you get it? I don't know where Chino is.

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't know where Chino is. I've never know where Chino is, not even when he lived in my house.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,900
So you're here in Mexico by chance, or what?

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,820
My patience is running out, girl.

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,660
No, my patience is running out.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,180
You killed my mom and Chino didn't show up, understand?

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,180
You're going to kill me and be humiliated because Chino won't show up

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,860
Because he doesn't care about me, or my mother, or anyone.

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,620
Hey, be careful.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,540
I'm not going to kill you because you're important to Chino.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to kill you for the pleasure of seeing you suffer.
