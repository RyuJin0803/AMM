1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,580
Dude.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,360
You outdone yourself, renting an apartment for the party?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,860
Well done, Sergio.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,540
Yeah.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,660
Hey, how many rooms does it have?

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,360
It has two.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,740
And one has a jacuzzi.

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,440
Really?

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,440
Just checking on you.

10
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

12
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,620
Hey, hey, I see you my man, you had action.

13
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,620
What a player.

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
You could have changed the sheets.

15
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,000
So who was here? Tell me.

16
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,260
I'm sorry, but a gentleman has no memory.

17
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,120
Don't be like that, surely you're writing to her...

18
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,340
Hey dude, give me my phone. Hey.

19
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,220
Don't start.

20
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,660
Give me my phone, dude. Now.

21
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,480
You've seen who it is, give it back.

22
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,940
Did you sleep with Juliana?

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't say anything dude..

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,860
Wait..
Please, don't say anything.

25
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,900
It was just once, it won't happen again, we're friends.

26
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,640
Friends? Friends with benefits..

27
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,840
Wait, isn't she gay?

28
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,980
How did you do it?

29
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,600
Dude, please.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Dude, I'm your friend. Tell me.
Okay, yes, shut up.

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can't say nothing dude, you know how things are, shut up.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Yes.

33
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
Don't worry, I won't say a thing.

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
Hello.

35
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Leave your message, I'll call you when I can.

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,180
Juls, I've been trying to get a hold of you all day.

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,920
Hey.

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're mad or if something happened we can talk, okay, but don't get away.
