1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,360
Why did you let Jacobo go?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,280
What do you want me to do?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,180
Tie his leg to the table, or what?

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,380
No, but you should have called me.
I did, you didn't answer.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,540
Here he is.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,980
Here.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,880
Do you know what you've done?

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,980
Hey, nothing happened. I'm a grown man, I can look after myself, okay.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,300
You can look after yourself?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,800
Yes.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,380
You know what happened with the narcos while you were gone?

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,160
Hey?

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,160
Alacran kidnapped my daughter.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,660
What?

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,660
You know what they want?

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,440
Obviously, they want to exchange her for Chino Valdés.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,640
You know who has Chino Valdés' body? Can you imagine or do I need to tell you?

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,960
You're not gonna turn him in to the narcos, right?

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,720
He's an important man, unlike you Beltrán.
Shut up.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,700
Ah you weren't worried about my body? Do you want to know what's happening now or not?

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,440
You know what I've been thinking?

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,940
What?

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,540
Your doctor, or anyone

24
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,860
Can give my body back.

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,140
So why not you, no?

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,660
I better turn you in to Alacran.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
He kills you,

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,540
Debt paid.

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm still alive and kicking..

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,280
And can finally enjoy life.

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,480
What do you think?

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,100
Excuse me?

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm kidding.

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,760
I wouldn't do something like that.

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm not capable.

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,860
You won't turn him in to the narcos?

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,500
How would I do that?

38
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,740
How? If it was me but this man isn't me.

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,800
So how are you planning to rescue your daughter?

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,720
We'll have to wait for Alacran to show up under our noses.

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,880
Since you're here, understand it.

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,440
You're staying here.

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,720
Don't let him out.

44
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,120
Shackle him.

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Shackles..
