1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,320
The soup is hot.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,840
If I were you, I'd eat it now while it's still hot.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,000
Look, this room was where your mom was.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,120
Hey.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,640
I swear to you, I don't know where El Chino is.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,240
My love, my love.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,200
Miss, you can't do that. Sit, please.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,440
Sit down.
Yes.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,060
Sit.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,900
Guille.

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,000
How are you? How are you being treated?

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,000
Good, good.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm good.

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,440
I hate to see you like this, it makes me sad.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how happy I am that you're both here.
