1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
So I'm your exchange currency to get your daughter back?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,300
No, no, no. He's joking, right Beltrán?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,360
You wouldn't do the same?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,820
And what, you think I'm just going to accept your stupid plan?

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,540
Oh no.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,300
No, no, let's calm down.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,800
You're going to kill me?

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,740
And the pact..

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,380
You have with them?

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,480
What will happen?

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,680
Let's say that the pistol is my way of convincing you.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,220
Are you in or out?

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,400
Put that away, for God sake.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,000
You're making me nervous.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
Don't be scared.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,520
I have a plan.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,960
Swap me for your daughter, yes?

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,540
Play A.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,780
I will make them believe that I'm giving you to them and they will give Juliana back.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm your bait, Beltrán?
Exactly.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,680
If everything goes well, nobody gets hurt. It's all good.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,020
Plan B. This will worry you.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,280
Something goes wrong,

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,980
Alacrán takes you, I take Juliana and the rest is your problem.

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,900
Good business, no?

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Maybe, that's why we were destined to meet.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,180
To pay my daughter's ransom with my own body. This one.

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,280
Are you in?

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,140
Beltrán, you have blood on your shirt.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm fine.

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,940
I'm going to try to find Alacrán.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,320
You know, no games, no leaving, no wandering off.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,880
Any nonsense and she will be the one who pays.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,400
And you..

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,180
He doesn't leave here.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,420
Because I swear, you'll find your house in ashes.

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,940
You know..

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody leaves this house.
