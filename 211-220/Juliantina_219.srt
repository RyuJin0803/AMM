1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,200
Renata has been here since you were brought in.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Seriously?

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,040
I swear.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,780
Yes, I never left.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,200
And I wasn't allowed to see you until now.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,280
My love, did you get the food I prepared for you?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,720
That was you?

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,140
No wonder it was so nice.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,000
I guess compared to what you get here, anything would be good.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,580
It was delicious.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,760
I swear this won't last much longer, okay?

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,100
I spoke with Eva and she's been talking to Mr Barreto,

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,080
We're going to do everything to convince Mr Castillo. I swear we will get you out of here.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,120
Yes, my love, we're all worried about you and doing everything we possibly can.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,640
I know.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,000
You don't know how much I miss you.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,100
I even miss your cat.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,800
Tlacoyo.

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,040
We miss you so much.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,640
Miss, that's prohibited.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,220
Relax.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,680
Relax.

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,340
Okay, I promise that this is the last time we will meet here.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,120
Next time we see each other, we will be eating something delicious at your house, with Tlacoyo, okay?

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,920
I promise.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,040
My love.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Promise me one thing..

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,580
You will hold up until the end like the Carvajal you are, okay?

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise you.
