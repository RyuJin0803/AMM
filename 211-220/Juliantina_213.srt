1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Don't dare answer the phone if you don't know the number.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Only answer if you know who it is, okay?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,400
What happened?

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,400
Juliana was kidnapped.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,720
What do you mean kidnapped?

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,080
It's Alacran's people.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,420
We have to really think about what we're going to do.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,920
If they call from Juliana's phone, the only one who answered is him. Here.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,520
They must keep thinking that you're dead.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,380
Another thing. It will be night soon.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,800
We have to be patient, we can't do anything until morning, yes?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,140
Do not go to the police or go looking for Juliana.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,240
Who are you to tell us what to do, huh?

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,380
I don't need to give you an explanation, kid.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm the only one who knows how to deal with a narco.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm the only real opportunity we have to get the girl back.

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,940
Okay, good, if you know so much about the narco's world..

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,500
Do you have any idea how to find El Chino Valdés?

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,880
Because he's the one they're looking for.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,580
Him.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,520
Chino Valdés.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
That's a good idea.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,980
See you later.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Lupita.
