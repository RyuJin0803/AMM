1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,120
I still have officer Montilla's number.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,160
I'm going to call him.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,520
No.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,300
We already told BeltrÃ¡n that we wouldn't call the police.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,540
How are you going to leave your daughter's life in the hands of a guy that you don't know, or where he came from.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,240
The only thing he has done is help me.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,040
Help you?

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,600
That's the most suspicious thing.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,740
Who knows what he want to get from all of this.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,880
Calm down, okay.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,240
Now isn't the time for jealousy.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,660
You're right, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,420
At least explain to me.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,640
Why do what he told you and not go to the police?

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,800
Tell me.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,720
I don't know.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:00,000
The police and the narcos are the same thing, no?
