1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,280
Val, what's up?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,140
Are you going to keep drinking?

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,540
I need to relax, okay? So I can make a decision.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,560
And you need to drink to relax?

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,660
Let's see. What is it? What can Lucho do?

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,300
What do you mean, what can Lucho do? Anything!

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,680
Didn't you see he's insane? I don't know, I don't--

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,060
He could go to school and tell everyone-- I hope not.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,560
But I don't know. I know him and he's going to do something, okay?

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,000
He's going to do something.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,920
Val.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,100
I want to go.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Now?

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,560
You want to go now? We won't even get to enjoy what's left of the day. Really?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,440
Val, we're not enjoying it.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,160
You're only thinking about what's going to happen.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,720
- Perfect. I'll tell Alirio.
- Val, no.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,020
- Hello, Lucho.
- Hello.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,180
What a miracle. You never came to see me before. I suppose you're here to tell me something important.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,840
Did you know your sister is into women?

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,060
What?!

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:00:00,000
I just saw Valentina kissing her friend Juliana at the Valle house.
