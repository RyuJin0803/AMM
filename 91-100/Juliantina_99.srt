1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
So.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,620
The four of us going out together is out of question, huh?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,100
Seriously, dude, I really cannot believe that a girl who sells lottery tickets took your girlfriend from you.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,340
- Stop making fun of me!
- What's the matter with you, idiot?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,420
Stop! Why are you fighting?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,780
Hey, stop!

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,180
Why are you fighting? You two are friends.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,760
I suppose that everything that's happened is to show us that all this is craziness.

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,060
And that we're not ready for it.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,820
You know, this is--

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
This is the most genuine thing I've ever felt.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,760
In my life, I mean.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,900
I don't want to let it go.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Are you sure?

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,360
Look at me.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,900
If you're in, I'm in.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,800
Let's make a deal, okay?

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,080
No matter what happens, or who comes between us,

19
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,000
You and I are together.

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
No one will tear us apart.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Deal.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:00:00,000
Deal.
