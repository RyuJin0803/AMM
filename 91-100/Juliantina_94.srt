1
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,140
- Okay, that's it.
- What?

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,680
- Where are you taking me?
- It's a surprise, I can't tell you.

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,800
If I tell you, it won't be surprise.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,940
But what surprise? Well, then tell me why you dressed me like this.

5
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,780
Stop.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,360
Why did I dress you this way? You choose your outfit.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,080
What?

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,040
It's super cool. Did you not like it?

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,200
No, yeah, of course I like it.

10
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,680
Dude, I think we're wasting our time.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,200
If Valentina was dating the driver, like you say, it would be him driving her, not this old guy.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,600
- Unless she's dating the old guy.
- Look, dude, I'm sure they're doing this to mislead us.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm assuming they meet outside the house and that Juliana helps them.

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,400
Oh, dude, you even made up your own soap opera and everything.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:00:00,000
- Fine, believe me or not, we're about to find out and that's it.
- All right, all right.
