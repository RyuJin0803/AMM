1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
The house is really beautiful.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
Yeah, it is very cozy.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,740
The sunlight is very nice. It's...

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,600
It's a very peaceful place.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,700
I mean, it still needs a couple of supplies, but Silvina will pack some things up.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,500
And I'll bring them later.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,880
Come on, I'll show it to you.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,180
I don't have enough words to thank you both

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,800
For everything you've done for me.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,880
There's no need.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,080
Careful.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,260
If you need anything, let me know and I'll bring it to you.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,100
No, no, no. You've done enough. Please.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,480
- Honestly, it's not a problem. Juls, we could--
- Huh?

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,700
Wanna go to the supermarket? We can buy the basics.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,140
No, please, you've done so much already.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,500
It's nothing, really.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,820
Yeah, that's good. Would it be a problem if I left you with my my mom?

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,380
No, not at all. It's okay, go with her.

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,459
We'll be right back.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,740
Let's go over there.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,560
- How big!
- Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,140
Look at that.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,800
That table... Like, how much can we eat on it?

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,980
A lot.

26
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,925
Where's the kitchen?

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,280
I think that's all, right?

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,480
But where's the toothpastes? And the toiletries? Is it there?

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Oh, they were probably left up there.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,520
Miss Valentina, I can go get them if you want.

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,880
Wait for me in the car, please.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
- Okay.
- Thank you.

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,180
- How weird, right?
- Yeah, I don't know where--

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,820
Seriously, I cannot

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,080
- Remember where I left it. 
- I've no idea.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,060
So weird.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Hey, Val.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Thanks for the house, really.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,200
I don't even know how to thank you.

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,860
No, you don't have to thank me.

41
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,540
I also did it for myself.

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,540
I wanted to keep you close.

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,900
But you do know we can't stay there forever, don't you?

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
Maybe you can?

45
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,180
I mean, your mom loved the house. Did you see how she was? She was super excited.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,620
No, Val.

47
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,940
When my mom feels better, she will want to leave this town.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't be like this.

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,620
Mmm?

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,700
Well...

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,500
I guess I'd rather you be away

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,280
But safe.

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:00:00,000
Which doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
