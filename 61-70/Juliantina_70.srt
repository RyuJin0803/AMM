1
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,480
Here's the bag, Miss.

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,140
Should we head to Tiberio and Silvina's house?

3
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah, we're making a pit stop first.

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,460
All right.

5
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,535
We weren't going to stop, were we?

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,200
I didn't want to stop.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,260
Did you want to stop?

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
So?

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,120
What are we going to do?

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, I don't know.

11
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,800
I have no idea.

12
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,540
I'm having a hard time thinking of myself as gay, to be honest.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,900
I'm also having a hard time thinking of myself as gay.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,120
So?

15
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,260
Look.

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,740
What I can tell you is that

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,440
I've never felt this way about a boy.

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
That's a fact.

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,580
Not even Lucho?

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Zero.

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,620
It's just--

22
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,100
You know what's the problem with you? It's that--

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,660
I can't stop thinking about you. It's like a

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,620
Broken record on a loop. It's embarrassing!

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,160
I can't stop thinking about you either.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
We're in love.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
With a woman?

28
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,640
Val.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,180
I'm in love with you.

30
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,760
So what are we going to do?

31
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,180
Lucho.

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,160
I should have ended this a long time ago. That's the truth.

33
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,760
It's perfect timing, 'cause right when--

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,340
Poor thing, he has been trying.

35
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,535
Yeah, the truth is

36
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,500
He has been very nice the last few days.

37
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,880
He went to the hospital, donated blood.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,720
I don't know what I'm going to tell him, poor guy.

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,600
Hey, Val, listen to me.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,560
This is something no one should judge.

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,140
Okay?

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,740
It's something only you and I understand.

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's fine.
