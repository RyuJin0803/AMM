1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,420
So now, you're leaving home as if I did something wrong, no?

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,520
The only one who did something wrong here is you.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,560
I did nothing wrong, okay?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,520
I know what I feel and I'll continue to do it whether you like it or not.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,420
But what did that girl do to convince you to do something like that?

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
What are you talking about? Why do you keep saying this stupidity?

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,760
She didn't do anything. Nobody planned it.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,480
It just happened, okay?

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,940
Well, you're not leaving.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,820
No?

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,280
Are you going to accept me as I am?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're my daughter.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,880
Of course I accept you.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,500
But I'm not going to accept you doing these indecent things, no!

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,300
Okay, that's why I'm leaving.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,740
Because you're not going to understand.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,560
Yeah?

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
And where are you going to go?

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
Are you going to sleep on the street?

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,020
I don't care where. I don't care.

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,520
No.

22
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,380
No, you want to leave to be with her.

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
Hey, hey what's wrong with you?
Lupita, Lupita.

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
Lupita, please. Calm down.

25
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,220
Come with me.

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,640
Come, please.

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,980
Come.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,780
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, but

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,680
There's a serious problem with Guille.

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,320
What happened?

31
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,880
No, I think there's been some confusion, but...

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,460
The police arrested him.

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,340
What for?
Yes, yes, I don't know what for, that's what I'm going to find out.

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,380
No, I'm coming with you.

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,260
No, Valentina, you need to stay here.

36
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,200
No, Eva..
Vale, stop..

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,260
I can call my dad, he's a lawyer and he can help...

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
No, do what you want. I'll call if something happens, okay?

39
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,260
Should I call?
No, yeah, obviously.

40
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,400
Of course.
Thank you.

41
00:01:24,540 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait for me. Eva.
Vale, wait.
