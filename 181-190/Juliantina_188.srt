1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
The problem is the video.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,460
Although, it could be the solution.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,140
What do you mean by that?

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,220
Guille appears in the video with an accomplice.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,460
Toño. But he doesn't want to talk about anything.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,540
Toño who?

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,240
Antonio Peñaloza? His friend?

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,260
Exactly, that's him.

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,560
They've been friends his whole life.

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,400
You knew?

11
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,020
That Guille wasn't alone?

12
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,780
Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you.

13
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,940
Guille told me everything.

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,720
Okay, tell us what happened.

15
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,840
Okay.

16
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,480
It was all Toño's idea.

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,660
One day they were drinking some beers,

18
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,700
And Toño came up with the idea to live an adventure.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
Something new for them.

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,620
Of course Guille didn't know they were going to rob a liquor store.

21
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,580
When they were there,

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
In the fear of everything, Guille couldn't get away.

23
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,660
And Toño fired a shot that hit the owner.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,920
I don't believe this.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,920
Such a silly way for Guille to ruin his own life.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,940
Okay, Eva. I've already explained to Renata that it was an accident.

27
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
So what can we do?

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,900
Nothing.

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,060
Baratto, does this information help get Guille out?

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
Yes, of course, but we have to find this Toño.

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,180
And we need a copy of that video.

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,620
I really need my brother to get out of here today.

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,960
That's not possible because by law,

34
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,160
You have to stay in custody for at least 48 house.

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,440
No, no.
Yes.

36
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,800
Besides, at this time, it's too late to do anything.

37
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,420
I advise you to get some sleep.

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,560
Early tomorrow, I'll see what I can do.

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.
