1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Not only that, but this could be a scandal that ruins my daughter's life.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,380
Don't fall in to the trap of what people say, Lupita.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,920
Juliana's happiness is more important than anything, for God sake.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,440
I don't care what people say..

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,580
What really worries me is that,

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,340
People who fall in love with the same sex...

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,840
What?

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,420
I don't think they're ever happy.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,140
Stop talking nonsense, that's not true, for God sake.

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,280
I know same sex couples who live happily.

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,840
No.

12
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,860
A normal life, yes. You're old-fashioned.

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,620
That's what you are.
No, I'm not old-fashioned, no.

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,120
I can't wrap my head around it.
Well, you have to read about...

15
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,220
I'm sorry that you had to find out that way.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,720
I understand that you can't fully understand it.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,880
It took me a while, too.

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,580
But I won't put my feelings aside, much less to please someone else.

19
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:00,000
So I've already made my decision to live alone.
