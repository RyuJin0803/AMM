1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,240
Hey, I'm so proud of you.

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,740
It's not easy.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,820
You did good.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,280
It's cold.

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:43,960
Val.

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,580
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,800
Please tell me you didn't come to talk about the same thing again, please.

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,620
Valentina, you asked for it.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,160
And I'm not referring to the narcos because...

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,019
That was really horrible and I'm so glad that you're okay.

11
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,040
But the rest..

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,740
What?

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,460
What do you me "what" Valentina,

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,860
I don't want to bother you, or talk about any of that.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,580
But...

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,320
The reality is that, since we broke up your life has gone out of control.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,080
You came to tell me that..

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,680
You're my axis, that kept me in line...

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,420
That's what I need to hear, yeah..
I didn't say that, Valentina.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,020
But you have to realize that,

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
You're easily influenced.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,180
I'm easily influenced?
Yes.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,880
That's why Juliana got what she wanted.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how do you know that it wasn't me who got what I wanted?
