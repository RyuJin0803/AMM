1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Perlita.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,080
Juliana.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,160
So good to see you, my girl.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,120
How are you?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Do you need something?

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,760
Yes. Honestly, I do, Perlita.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,520
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,580
I wanted to see if you could give me a job.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,340
Let's see what I can get you.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,800
Don't worry.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,400
I care about you a lot and if I can help you out,

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm happy to.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,740
Thank you.
How is your mom?

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,960
Good, good. She's much better.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm going to get you some verdolagas for you to take home...
No, Perlita. No.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,700
What?

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm no longer living with her.

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,180
How?

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,320
Where are you living?

20
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,700
It's nothing, I was thinking about finding a hotel while I find somewhere...

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,460
No, no. You're not staying at a hotel.

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,940
No, I won't allow it.

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,240
Stay here, we have a cot.

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,260
At least until we find something better.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,060
Yes.

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,920
Yes, that would really help.

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,960
Of course.

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
Thank you, Perlita.

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,580
Let's go.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go get you some things.
Thank you.
