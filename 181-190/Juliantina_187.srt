1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:01,840
Eva.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,080
Ah Baretto, I'm glad you're here.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,380
Things are very bad.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,360
Is it true they're blaming Guille for the assault?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,860
Yes.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,580
Apparently, a man was injured, who fortunately for us, is still alive.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,560
Baretto..

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,160
I need you to get my brother out of this place.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Well, first I need to talk to him.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,500
I also have to see what the situation is with the police.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,620
But I will ask that they let me see him, okay?

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,140
Yes.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,020
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,540
Renata.

15
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,440
Valentina.

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,920
What's wrong?

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,980
We were in Mrs Castillo's house when the police arrived and..

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,520
Renata.

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,380
You can't say anything.

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,260
Do you not realise that anything you say is going to be used against Guillemo.

21
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,980
Relax, Eva.

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,100
No, you too, LucÃ­a, why did you bring Valentina?

23
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,480
She's in a bad place after everything that has happened, she's sensitive.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm right here, okay.

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm listening and I also want to know what happened with Guille, okay?

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,020
Do whatever you want.

27
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,040
We will.

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,620
Can we help you with anything?

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm so scared.

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,480
No, everything will be okay.

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be out soon.
