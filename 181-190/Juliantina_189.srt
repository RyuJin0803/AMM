1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
I won't be able to sleep without knowing where my daughter is.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,080
I won't tell you not to worry but...

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,520
Juliana isn't a kid anymore.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,280
She's grown up, she can take care of herself.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,680
And if she's left the city?

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,700
If I don't see her again?

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,260
No.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,820
Don't think about those things.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
Don't be negative.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,240
It was my fault.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,220
You warned me.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm going to lose her.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,320
No.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,460
Don't say that.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,100
I'm sure she will come back.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,420
You two will talk and everything will be okay.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now, you have to clear your mind, but everything will be okay.
