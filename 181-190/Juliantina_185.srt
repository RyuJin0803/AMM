00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,340
Mateo.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,620
Hi.
Hello.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm glad you're here.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,260
Did Eva come back?

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,340
No, she's..

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,320
She's dealing with Guille's thing.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,640
What happened with Guille?

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,920
He was arrested.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
He was arrested?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,440
Why?

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,620
I don't know, that's what Eva went to find out.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,940
But she won't answer the phone so no,

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
I don't know anything.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,500
And, Lucho's dad offered a helping hand, if we need it.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,760
He's a lawyer.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Thank you very much, but Barreto should deal with this. He's the company's lawyer.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me get my phone, I'll be right back.
