1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,320
Don't go.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,620
Understand me, my child.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,100
We've always got along.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,060
We tell each other everything.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,880
This hit me like a bucket of cold water,

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,520
I never neglected you.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,360
Tell me what I did wrong. Tell me.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,500
Mom, what I feel has nothing to do with how you raised me.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,600
It's not right for you to feel guilty for something that has nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,240
Stay.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,480
I'll be more concerned, if you leave.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,600
And worse if you go to Valentina's house.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,940
That won't happen.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,960
Valentina and I aren't together anymore.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,660
Because of people who judge what we feel...

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:00:00,000
Like you.
