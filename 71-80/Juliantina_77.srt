1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,960
Won't you tell us who makes you so happy?

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,260
Look at you.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,680
I-- I don't think you know her.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,940
And...?

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,320
It's just an affair?

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,480
- No.
- Of course. Okay, it's fine.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,940
Guille, it's fine that you have them. Okay?

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,120
Just be very careful. Don't get the girl pregnant

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,520
And have kids all around, because then what would you do with your life?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,440
- Enjoy it. Enjoy it. 
- Sorry, I have to take this.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,580
We haven't finished this talk, ok?

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,500
So, my sister is kind of heavy during breakfast, huh?

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,960
Okay, let's see.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,280
You may have gotten rid of her, but you will tell me.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,820
- Who is she?  
- Guess it.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,900
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,220
Right. Paula?

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,760
- No.
- Is it Regina? She's that-- That blondie with--

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,280
- No.
- Okay. Um... It's Clau. The one that carries the envelopes?

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,060
- You know who! She's always bringing stuff to the--
- No.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,100
Okay, well. Give me tips. You're obviously not helping me enough.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,680
She works with me.

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,400
- Renata.
- Uh-huh.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,040
- It's Renata? Oh! It's Renata!
- Quiet! She's going to hear you.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,360
That pleases me, because, to be honest, I didn't trust your taste, but knowing it's...

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,400
Renata.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,580
I feel-- I mean, it gets me in another mood, you know?

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,620
Like, she's cute, she's sweet, she's nice.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,600
- What about you?
- I like her. What? Me?

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,080
Tell me your secret.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,240
From the other day.

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,060
No, this-- This is not the right place, because

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,740
Eva's out there.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,320
So... When it's my secret, it is a good place, right?

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,340
- But not yours?
- Well, it was your mistake, you're dumb.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,740
You know what? Somewhere else. I'll tell you.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,300
Let's go somewhere.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:00:00,000
- Eat now.
- All right.
