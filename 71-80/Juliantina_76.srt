00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,860
[SERGIO: Wanna meet up today?]

2
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,420
Mom?

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,380
Mom?

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,480
We're having breakfast.

5
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,380
- Hello.
- Mom isn't here.

6
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,660
What? She disappeared?

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm telling you, she's not here. I just woke up, looked for her and she's not here.

8
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,300
I need you to come, please, Panchito.

9
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,335
- Relax. I'm coming over.
- You're not going anywhere.

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,880
Can't those woman manage things on their own?

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,000
- Listen, Pancho, I'm telling you, if you put a foot out of this house--
- I'm sorry. I'll explain it to you latter. This is urgent.

12
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,940
- Little sister!
- Hello.

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,220
How you doing?

14
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,740
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,200
I know exactly why you're like this. I heard you coming home last night.

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,720
- Uh-huh.
- Don't act dumb.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
- What?
- What?

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,960
How embarrassing. Look at your face, you're all--

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,700
In love. What's up? I mean, that face, those sparkling eyes.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,980
And, oh, that brushed hair.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,820
You know what? I should go to Valle more often, that's the truth.

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,240
It is the perfect place for secret love.

23
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,900
And you're telling me all the details right now.

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,040
I think I'm in love.

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,320
- Yeah, I've figured that.
- No, no, but--

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,700
This girl is incredible. She's humble, she's...

27
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,240
Fun, we laugh together.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,260
She makes me a better person, you see?

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,640
- Oh, well, that is something. That's a hard thing.
- Why do you say that? Huh?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,880
- What's the matter with you?
- Okay, okay. Fine.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,640
Spill the beans. What I need to know is the name and last name. I want to know--

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,300
- Why do you--
- I need to know! Who is the woman that has you like this

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,460
Drooling. I want to know who it is you like so much--

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,560
Yes, Guille, come on, tell us. Who's this amazing woman that makes you so excited.

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?
