1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Look at all the things Val borrowed me.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,020
They're beautiful, she's got really good taste, hasn't she?

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,360
Look at this.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,920
Mom?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,860
Mom, what's up?

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,660
You're very odd.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,860
What happened? You said you liked this place.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,620
It's not that, honey.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,100
It's just that lately I've been thinking a lot about Chino.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,940
No.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,660
Come on, mom! No.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
We had agreed on that this was in the past, why are you--?

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,680
And even after all the things he's done to you. I just don't understand you!

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,720
Honestly.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,520
Well, just--

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,580
Forget all the grudges and forgive him.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,560
- No, but--
- Don't hate him.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,360
What the heck is bugging you?

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,400
Why are you a mess because of Chino again?

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,760
Don't mind me.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm too sensitive because of all the things that's happened.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,840
[Jacobo speaking in other languages]

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,140
So, can Chino speak three other languages?

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,600
Can he talk about finances, about numbers? Think a little, please!

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,860
I don't understand.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,940
And you think I do?

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,900
I don't understand how I came back to life after being dead either.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,540
Let's suppose you're not Chino.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,160
- Where is he?
- I have no idea. And I know it's too weird for you.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,640
Yes, I know it's weird to think that I'm in your husband's body.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,760
That I'm talking from someone else's soul. It is just as weird to me!

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,320
Hey.

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,800
Mom.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.
