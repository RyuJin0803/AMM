1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Oh, well, against all odds,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,780
- We did it. And I think you have everything you need to survive in this house.
- I know.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,080
- Cheers.
- Seriously, yeah. How lucky. We're lucky you rescued us.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,520
Imagine if I'd left to another city.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,580
Or country.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,460
- Or whatever.
- Oh, no!

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,540
- No, don't say that. 
- No.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,420
- I'd die.
- No.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,320
What's this?

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,320
"Death is Only a Portal"?

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,360
Yes, don't judge me, okay?

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,980
What is this?!

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,840
It's a book! An amazing book by Camilo Guerra.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,860
Who is Camilo Guerra?

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,940
He's a friend of my dad's.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,060
Sorry.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,920
Very dear and very handsome, as you can see.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
He's handsome.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,560
And this book became like, a bible, because it's helped me a lot.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,980
With dealing with my father's death, so.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,280
How did it help you?

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,680
It made me consider that maybe he's not totally dead. Don't judge me!

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,140
- What?!
- Yes.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,440
- That's what this book is about?
- No!

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,440
The book is about...

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,520
Reincarnation.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,040
About reincarnation. And more specifically about

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,420
When you have unfinished business, you come back to life

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
To finish them. Don't you laugh!

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
- Why are you laughing? You don't believe me!
- Well, because these things are obviously not true.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
- Of course they are.
- Of course not. Okay, listen.

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,580
Chino died. Strangely, he resurrected and on top of that

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,180
- He came back saying he was coming from a different life.
- Really? And you don't believe him?

34
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,640
- No!
- And you think I'm a fool too?

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,280
Come on, Val. Chino's head was obviously screwed up because of all the things he did.

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,020
Because of the way his brain got fried.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,860
Or he was telling the truth!

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,080
No, Val! Look, obviously everything has a scientific explanation.

39
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,800
This book-- The same way you see Camilo here, so handsome!

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,940
He's also a scientist.

41
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,540
And the researches he does are totally serious, I'm telling you.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, right.

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,400
I mean,

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,360
I know what we're going to do.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,980
We're going to meet with him so he can explain his theories, because you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,540
- And, truly, when it comes out of his mouth, it makes a lot of sense.
- Okay, yeah.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,420
Yeah? Okay.

48
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,200
Fine. It would be cool to see what he's going to tell me, the scientist.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see what he says.
