1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,740
We were better then ever.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,320
We haven't argued in a while. Why do you want to break up?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,040
Look, I know you've been trying really hard, okay?

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,060
And, really, I appreciate it. It makes all the difference, but it's just--

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,280
Right now, I'm--

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,260
I'm very confused.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,860
Confused?

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,060
You're breaking up with me because you're confused? With what?!

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,020
It's been--

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,780
A very hard time. And I'm still--

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,900
A mess because of my father's death.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,300
- I don't mean to hurt you, okay?
- Look, Val.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,060
I understand perfectly how hard it is.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,880
But it's a matter of time and I'm decided to accept.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,380
And to wait for as long as you need.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,720
You are not understanding.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,120
Lucho, I don't want you to wait for me, okay?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,980
It's over.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,320
There's someone else, isn't there?

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,620
- No, there's no one else--
- You're not leaving until you tell me what's going on.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,440
Who's the asshole you're with?

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,980
We're not finished talking. Who you're cheating on me with?

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,880
- No one!
- Who you're cheating on me with?

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,280
- Respect what I just told you!
- I won't let you go until you tell me who it is!

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,360
Hey, hey. What are you doing? Let her go. Let her go.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,700
If you're caught making another scene, they're going to expel you.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,700
Calm down, dude. Come on! Relax.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,560
Hey, hey, hey. Relax, man.

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,360
I broke up with Lucho.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,420
- What? You broke up with him?
- Yeah. I don't know how I did it, but it's done.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,760
- But... Did you tell him everything that's happened?
- No, you're crazy? He'd kill me.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,020
Juls.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,300
I need to see you.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,300
Can I come over?

35
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,185
Yes, obviously, come over. Yes, of course.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll see you there. Bye.
