1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Well I-- I--

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,480
You're in love with a girl?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,540
I mean, I think so.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,400
I mean, I'm pretty sure I am.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,440
But why are you crying?

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,700
There is--

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,360
Absolutely nothing wrong with it.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,560
I thought you were going to tell me something... Actually serious.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,060
I don't know what people are going to say when they hear that--

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,140
Dad! I mean, if he was alive, what would dad say?

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,400
Or mom. Or Eva! Can you imagine how Eva will be like?

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,780
No, no, no. But listen... Listen to me, Val.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,580
It should not matter to you what people are going to say, understood?

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,460
What matters here is you.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,820
Your feelings.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,220
- I mean, do you still feel something for Lucho?
- No!

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,720
There's your answer!

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,020
You don't have to keep wondering.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But yes,

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,220
I do have to tell you that--

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,060
You need to tell him.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,860
I don't think it's nice to cheat on anyone.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,640
It's not pretty.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,040
But I don't know what to tell him. What should I tell him?

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,300
Tell him whatever you're comfortable with.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
But you have to be honest with him.

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,880
It's the least you can do.

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,640
And, well, who are we talking about?

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,240
Juliana?

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,320
What can I tell you?

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,000
I like it.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Because... I see you happy.

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,420
That's what matters the most to me.

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,800
Not having to put up with your bad mood.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,800
Thank you.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Hey.

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,020
Where were you? I've been calling you.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,340
What's wrong?

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:00:00,000
We need to... Talk. Please, come.
