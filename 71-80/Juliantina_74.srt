1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,560
I mean, my daughter--

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,460
My daughter Valentina kissing another girl. No, not another girl, sorry, correction.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,060
My daughter Valentina kissing a girl who in this life is also my daughter.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,000
No, Juliana is not your daughter, don't exaggerate.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,800
- Completely, you're exaggerating.
- Don't tell me now to grow up, Camilo, please!

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,440
21st century! 21st century, homosexuality--

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm not talking about homosexuality, I know my daughter!

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,700
My daughter had three boyfriends, I've met them, my daughter is heterosexual.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,920
Listen to what I'm going to say.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,820
Three boyfriends, four or five. Whatever it is! She's not interested in men.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,820
She's experimenting with another girl. What's the problem?

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,300
- Enough?
- Huh? What's the problem?

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,160
- Enough?
- Yes.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,200
Can I speak to my friend instead of doctor Guerra?

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,280
- Completely.
- I know you don't have kids. Try to understand me! Seat here and try to understand me!

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,060
- I am trying to help you!
- Well, then help me understand.

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,880
Why everything I've done, that I thought was right, turned out it was wrong!

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,760
She's experimenting with another girl, let her be.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,860
I don't have a problem with her experimenting, that's not the problem.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:00:00,000
If this happens, can you imagine the mess we'll be in?
