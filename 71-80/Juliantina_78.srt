1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,000
Relax... What happened?

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,840
I'm a little nervous because I haven't told anyone yet.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
But is everything okay?

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
Okay...

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,100
It's that--

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,360
It's-- It's so intimate, to be honest, so...

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,860
You're scaring me, Val.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,120
If it's scaring you, you wouldn't know--

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,280
You wouldn't know how I'm feeling.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,740
Hey, but...

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,300
Look at me.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Hey.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,620
You can trust me.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,040
You know that?

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm in love.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,160
With a girl.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,900
Lupita.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,700
Mom!

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,860
What happened?

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,800
- We were very worried.
- You're okay?

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
Yes, I'm fine.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,960
Well, sorry I made you worried.

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,120
Why didn't you say anything?

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,400
I just went to the hospital to thank the man that helped me.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,440
I don't know, I just woke up feeling like it, so I went.

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,380
I didn't think you'd get worried.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,860
Listen carefully, Lupita.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,920
Your life isn't the same anymore. You're still in danger. You can't--

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't just go out like that again, please.
