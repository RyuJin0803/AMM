1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,520
Ugh, this door.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,580
My girl!

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,600
- Chivis.
- Were the things I sent through Jacobo useful?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah. Yeah, they were. We only came here to get some clothes for Juliana and that's it.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,440
Well, then go ahead. I'll go get some fresh water with your friend, yes?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,860
- Yeah. In fact, that would be nice.
- Yeah, it's okay. I'll be right there.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,040
I'll go upstairs.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,340
Silvina, thank you so much for lending me your house.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,380
I did it for Valentina.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,180
I wanted to tell you that--

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,560
Although I'm aware of what you and your mother are up to, I don't care about what happens to my house.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,280
What does worry me is Valentina.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
I don't want anything bad to happen to her.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,040
Because she's been hanging around with you.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,840
She's an angel.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,620
She's always willing to help the others.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,680
Don't take advantage of her naivety.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,680
I'll go fetch the water.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,360
What is it? What's up with that face?

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
You know what?

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,400
I think Silvina doesn't like me.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,600
Um...

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,720
I don't think that's possible.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Silvina is surely happy you're living at her house.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,840
- No, Val.
- What?

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Silvina doesn't want me to be near you.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,180
Wait.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,120
Silvina is super protective. But she's super kind and super good.

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,600
But if there's someone in this world who's kinder and better, it's you.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,920
So, believe me, that's not an option.

31
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,005
Val, what's up, huh?

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,760
- With what?
- You're acting so nonchalantly.

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,860
I mean, it's like you're not realizing what's happening.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,420
Don't you think we're--

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,960
Making a mistake?

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
Um...

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,600
I don't-- I don't understand.

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,180
You're scaring me a little. I don't understand what's going on.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,400
Don't you think we should give each other some space?

40
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:15,215
So each of us can think about what's happening.

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,140
So each of us can think about what we're feeling.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
And then go back to our normal lives?

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, I'm very sure of what I want and of what I'm feeling.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,180
And let me tell you that my normal life stinks.

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay? And that everything-- Listen to me, everything!

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,880
Is better now you're in my life.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:00:00,000
And I want this to be my normal life.
