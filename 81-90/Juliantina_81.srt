1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,940
So... Are you sure this is where the guy she left you for lives?

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,840
Valentina never comes to the south side.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,100
No way.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,420
Do you see who that is?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,880
Hey, after acting like Sherlock Holmes, at least now I know where Juliana lives.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,280
Thank you. How thoughtful, champ.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,920
There's no problem.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,680
Sooner or later I'll find out who the dude is.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,180
Let's go.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,700
Let's go.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,500
- What happened? Tell me.
- A bunch of things. But he was super intense.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,640
- He reacted in a really violent way. Really badly.
- What?

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,140
I swear it. He went back to being the old Lucho. It was impressive.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,800
- But violent how? Did he do something to you?
- No, no, no. He didn't do anything to me.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,580
But he went mad. Plus, he thinks I'm seeing someone else.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,200
Obviously, he thinks I'm seeing a guy.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,960
- What?
- Can you imagine how he would react if he found out about this?

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,240
- No, shut up.
- No, he would go crazy.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,700
Can you imagine how our families will react when they find out?

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,520
Well, I already told Guille.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,520
- What?!
- Uh-huh.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,660
And he took it really well.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,900
- Really?
- Yes, I swear.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,120
I don't think my mom will react like he did.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,460
She's very traditional.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
Well... She can compete against Eva.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,020
Eva will surely send me to a boarding school in Switzerland or something like that.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,620
You know what?

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,180
I don't think we should tell anyone yet.

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,360
Okay. Yeah, you're right. Better not.

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,380
Let's wait a little more.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,640
- Yes.
- Yes, and for some weird reason, you look very pretty when you're right.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,800
I brought something.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
They're are my favorite, so I hope you guys like it.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,140
You shouldn't have bothered.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,900
I don't want you to keep spending money on us.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,000
No, it's-- It's no bother at all, really.

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,660
Besides, my father taught me to

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,420
Share the things I like with the people that I love, so...

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,180
Well, when I start working again, I'll pay you back every cent, okay?

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,580
Mom.

42
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,660
You haven't even fully recovered and you're already thinking about working?

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
Honey, we need the money.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,020
- If we need money, I'll work. Not you.
- No.

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,480
Look.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,520
We already talked about it. I want you to go back to school.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,020
What happened to the fashion school?

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,920
I missed the admission exam. It happened when we were at the hospital.

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,140
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,280
I know you really wanted to do that.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,420
- We'll look for a way to fix it, okay?
- Okay.

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm very sorry you missed it because you were taking care of me.

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,420
Mom, it's fine.

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,080
We can still fix it, right?

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,780
Yes, for sure.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, the moment I'm recovered, we'll leave this town and I'll work very hard so you can go back to school.
