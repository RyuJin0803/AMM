00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Jacobo,

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,320
Are you-- Are you all right?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,120
I'm always so involved with my dramas and my weird world that I end up forgetting about other people.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,260
Are you all right? You can tell me anything, Jacobo, okay?

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,440
What is it?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,620
Nothing.

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,580
Nothing. I--

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,460
I appreciate it, but--

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,060
I don't even know I'm like this. I'm okay, but thank you anyway.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
Thank you for worrying.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Jacobo,

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,560
I don't know what's up, but

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm glad you're here.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Thank you.

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,580
Thank you. Honestly, thank you.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,040
The driver?!

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
All this?

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,960
- All this because of the damn driver?
- That's enough.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,620
I made you a question.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,220
- That's who you're cheating on me with?!
- Shut up now! Now!

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,360
What is going on here?

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,960
Tell her.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, tell her. Or I'll do it!
