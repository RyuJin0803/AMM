1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,720
You always smell so good, how do you do it?

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,500
And your skin, it's so soft!

3
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,840
You're okay?

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,540
I'm nervous.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
Me too.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,100
Do you want--?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,280
- Do you want us to-- Stop?
- No.

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,500
- Are you sure?
- No, I don't. I don't want us to stop.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Me neither. So...

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,220
This is the perfect moment to really know how we feel.

11
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,320
Come on, I have an idea.

12
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,920
My girl?

13
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,860
- Can I come in?
- Go away, Chivis!

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,020
- Are you having breakfast here?
- No!

15
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,320
- Just a juice?
- Go! Not right now.

16
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,080
All right. I'll wait.

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,860
Sorry.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,380
I don't know what came into her today.

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,440
What?

20
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,900
What?

21
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,939
What, what?

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,040
What, what?

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
I feel weird.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Me too.

25
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,260
But, hey, I suppose it's normal, right?

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,920
It was the first time we did something like that.

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,600
Yes.

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
- Val.
- What?

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
I think I better go.

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,620
No, don't go.

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,380
- Val, what if someone comes in?
- No, no one is coming in.

32
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,400
Stay with me, please.

33
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,440
You know what? I'll ask Silvina to make us some "chilaquiles", she makes them super good.

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,860
And green juice.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,800
Good morning.

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,380
Where's everyone else?

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,880
The spider's left already.

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
I think Guille did too and Valentina is upstairs, in her room.

39
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
It's Eva.

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,160
You know what?

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:00:00,000
- Let's go somewhere else, it's better. Yeah?
- Yes, yes.
