1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Come on, stop drinking, Lucho.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,780
What the hell are we doing here, Lucho? We have exams tomorrow.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,800
- Let's go.
- Dude! Wait!

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm sure the guy Valentina is seeing won't take too long.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,980
Yes. And how can you know?

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,520
Because obviously she told him we broke up and he will want to comfort her.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,860
- You know what, dude? I have to go, I need to study--
- Hey, hey, hey!

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
Let's go, dude! I need to study!

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,820
Back me up here, don't be a bad friend.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,000
Bad friend? Really?

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,880
Dude, we've been following your girl for hours!

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,260
I can't feel my legs, I need to go to the bathroom and you call me a bad friend?

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,340
- Great. Cool.
- I would do the same for you.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,500
So we're not leaving.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,160
Juliana?

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
- Yeah?
- You got a text message.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm coming. Thanks.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,980
Thanks.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,980
[VALENTINA: I can't stop thinking about you.]

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
What?

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
Did you read this?

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,540
No. No, of course not.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
Now what happened to her?

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,100
Well, I don't know. She got a text on her phone, I told her and--

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,980
She thought I read it?

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,840
- Maybe she's seeing someone.
- No.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
I would know. She tells me everything.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh, Lupita.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,660
I'll tell you something.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,040
We all have secrets.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,100
Even you.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:00:00,000
You have a secret behind those eyes that you don't wanna tell me.
