1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,020
I won't let you treat me like this.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,480
I knew you were cheating on me. Tell me who it is.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,460
- Tell me who it is!
- What? What are you talking about?

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,180
Who are you cheating on me with?!

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,800
- What's wrong with you? You're hurting me.
- And you think you're not hurting me?

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,340
- Lucho!
- Lucho, let me go.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,740
I did everything you asked me. I was the perfect boyfriend!

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,920
- Who are you sleeping with?!
- You're drunk, stop!

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,500
- Get out of here!
- And who are you?!

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,180
- Out of here, now!
- I won't go until she tells me--

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,560
- Stop yelling and get out!
- Who are you sleeping with?

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,460
- Please, please!
- You will regret it, Valentina.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,760
You'll regret it!

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,820
Are you all right, my love? How are you feeling?

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,740
- Silvina, give that boy some coffee, please.
- Yes.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,460
Hey, hey. Calm down. Look at me.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,980
- You're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,460
Honey,

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,260
Do you remember when I was at the hospital and you said you thought you had seen Chino?

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,860
Mom, I didn't see him, I imagined him. You said it yourself.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,300
No, right, but--

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
I was all like... Confused.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,980
How was it?

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,200
Um... I went into the cafeteria and--

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
Chino was there ordering coffee. I called him, but he didn't listen. I followed him and

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,600
I went after him,

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,680
But couldn't find him anymore. I dunno.

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,860
What? Don't tell me you want to go look for him.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
No, no, no. It's not that.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,620
Do you believe in that story he told us

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,480
At that hotel in San Antonio, after the hurricane?

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
What story?

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,580
That one, that he wasn't Chino. That he was someone else.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,500
Ugh, mom, I don't know. That was very weird.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,380
What I think is that Chino wanted to get rid of us and start a new life.

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,020
Do you think that's possible?

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I mean--

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,620
That someone dies and then ends up inside someone else's body?

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,380
Mom, of course not.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,540
That's bullshit. Chino was obviously nuts because of all the things he got himself into, and then

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,880
Because of the electrocution.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,700
So you--

43
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,515
You don't think anything happens after we die?

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,520
Valentina is actually reading a book about that.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,060
Oh, yeah?

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,300
But I think she's reading it hoping it'll help her overcome all the things that happened to her father.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:00:00,000
I think that-- When you die, you die. Right?
