1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,840
I'm sorry, Jacobo. I feel like I'm always crying.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,180
I swear my life is not like this. Well, it didn't use to be, but lately...

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,240
Perhaps we are all going through the same thing today.

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,680
It's just that--

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
I don't want to hurt anyone, I swear it, I don't--

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,760
Vale.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Hey.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,240
Can I give you an advice?

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,580
Try to breathe.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,860
And to take your time.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,680
And try to think about what it is that's really happening to you.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,360
And do the right thing.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,760
It's just that it's very hard to know what is the right thing, because--

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,980
The right thing to me or the right thing to the others?

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,960
- Because it seems like they're not the same, you know?
- The only thing I ask you is to try to--

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,200
Act with honesty.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,420
I think that what matters is that you be honest with him and with yourself.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
You say that because of Lucho?

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,120
I'll talk to you as if I--

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,320
As if I was-- Well--

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,240
As a man, and if I was your--

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,780
As if you were my daughter.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,080
Don't break his heart.

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,740
I mean, try to-- Try to understand that it's a human being we're talking about, a person.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,420
And that maybe he's in love, just like you are.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,580
So the only thing I ask you is to understand him

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,520
And to really be honest, because there's also a person on the other side.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Jacobo,

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,360
Are you-- Are you all right?

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm always so involved with my dramas and my weird world that I end up forgetting about other people.

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,240
Are you all right? You can tell me anything, Jacobo, okay?

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,140
What is it?

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Nothing.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,580
Nothing. I--

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,340
I appreciate it, but--

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,560
I don't even know I'm like this. I'm okay, but thank you anyway.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,300
Thank you for worrying.

38
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
Jacobo,

39
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,560
I don't know what's up, but

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,460
I'm glad you're here.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
Thank you.

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,740
Thank you. Honestly, thank you.

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,200
The driver?!

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,660
All this?

45
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,460
- All this because of the damn driver?
- That's enough.

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,580
I made you a question.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,900
- That's who you're cheating on me with?!
- Shut up now! Now!

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,320
What is going on here?

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,980
Tell her.

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, tell her. Or I'll do it!
