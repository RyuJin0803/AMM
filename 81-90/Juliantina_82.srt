1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,060
Hey.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,280
Hey.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,540
Did you hear about what happened?

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,040
Another murder by the narcs... For a change.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,100
Do you think it's the same people that killed dad?

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
I don't know.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,440
Who are you texting like this?

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,540
Renata, but she's not answering.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,360
But she's okay? Did something happened to her?

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,740
No.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,540
Eva found out about my relationship with Renata.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,480
Mayela told her.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,720
And so you can imagine.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,700
She decided she's not my assistant anymore and transferred her to the management department.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,080
Your sister doesn't have much sense.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,840
Who does she thinks she is?

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,800
She thinks she's the family's matriarch?

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,100
That she can tell us what to do, who to date?

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,940
- I swear to you, everything was perfect--
- Until she found out.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,940
That's the price of secrets in this house.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,440
Honestly, it makes me feel really bad to think about

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,460
What will happen when Eva finds out about me.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,040
I broke up with Lucho.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,980
How was it?

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,680
Ugh, well--

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,560
Well, It's Lucho. He took it awfully.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,140
You know how it is.

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,480
He acted violently. Obviously, he thinks I'm dating someone else, so he tried to force me to say it.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,220
I'm very scared to think that--

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,380
All the outside things could ruin a relationship that is just beginning, you know?

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,060
And that's our problem.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,800
That we allow

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,260
- Other people to interfere in our lives, you see?
- Always did it.

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,860
I mean, Eva trying to control us,

35
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,740
Lucho getting mad at you. I mean--

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,400
Do whatever you want. If you want to be with Juliana and that makes you happy,

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
Do it.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,060
Me too. If i want to be with Renata, then that's it.

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,740
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So, what?

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,820
- They manipulate us. That's--
- Uh-huh. Exactly.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,620
I'm happy that you made this decision, honestly.

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,340
We're good. You and I, we're good. Here.

43
00:02:38,780 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's fine.
