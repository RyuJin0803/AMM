1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,620
They shot him in broad daylight.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,140
I mean, it's--

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,100
It's been too many murders involving my family. I'm in panic. I don't know what to do.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,620
No, Val, calm down.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,500
Hey, look. There's a bunch of bodyguards all around you house. Nothing will happen.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,620
Ugh! I just can't relax. Plus,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,980
Lucho... He made a scene because he was drunk and

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,960
He thinks I'm dating the driver. Please!

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,480
What?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,440
You mean like, Alirio?

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,520
- No, Jacobo.
- Regardless, I mean, why would he think that?

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, I don't know. He's crazy.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,500
I mean, I was feeling down and Jacobo gave me a hug and he literally understood everything wrong.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,460
Juls, honestly,

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,780
Ever since my father died I haven't had a moment to breathe.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,620
I just haven't.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,980
No, Val, calm down.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,100
Hey.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,540
I don't like it when you're like that.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,800
I would love to be with you.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,460
But I can't leave my mother alone.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,100
I know.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,680
Listen.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,080
I think--

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,040
There's someone at the door.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,520
- I'll call you later.
- Hey. Take care, okay?

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Yeah. Bye.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Hey.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
It's cold.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,920
How are you?

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,800
Panchito is there. At the house, so I was able to escape.

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,660
I honestly could only think about seeing you so

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,040
Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
Let's go upstairs? Yeah?

35
00:02:10,940 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go.
