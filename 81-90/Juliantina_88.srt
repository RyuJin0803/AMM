1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Will you keep staring at me?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,980
You're leaving me for the driver?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,480
Why do you think that?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,040
You didn't see them hugging? Comforting each other lovingly.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,520
He's my friend, okay?

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,100
So now you're friends with the help and you even hug them, huh?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,940
Hey, hey, hey.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,880
Why don't you calm down and let Jacobo explain what's happening, please?

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,820
I will give you an advice so you better

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,240
Listen to it carefully.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,440
You should be a little more respectful to someone who loved you.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,400
That speaks very badly of you.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,120
Understood?

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,640
Everything okay?

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,340
Tiberio, it's with you.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,340
I think you better go, Lucho.

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,920
I can't believe it, Valentina.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,000
You're fooling around with the driver?

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,240
You're stooping so low.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,440
You'll pay for it.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
You will pay for it.

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:00:00,000
Tiberio, go with him.
