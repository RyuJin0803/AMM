1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,120
Montilla.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,100
Juliana was kidnapped, I need you to help me find her, please.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,140
Look, calm down. Sit down, lets...

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,360
No, I can't calm down because I know that the..

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,840
First hours in a kidnapping are crucial to find the victim. So we need to do something now!

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,820
Look, if you relax, sit down and let me explain, then I can do something.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,740
If you don't, then I can't.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,180
Okay.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,280
She was taken from the..

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,360
Restaurant and I think that it was..

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,160
I think, it's the same people who are trying to find El Chino.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,660
El Alacrán will be one step ahead of us.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,100
What do you mean Alacrán is one step ahead of us?

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,320
She can't be kidnapped, okay? She has to be back here with me.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,400
You have to prevent them from hurting her, please. What are we going to do?

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,120
Calm down. We're going to do what's best.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,700
That is not what's best!

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,380
You need to do absolutely everything that's necessary to bring her back.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,960
If you tell me that you will find her and she will be fine, then I will calm down.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,520
Please.
We are going to do what's best, but I can't promise you anything.

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,520
What's happening?

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,720
Jacobo is back.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,320
Is he with you?

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,620
He's waiting for you.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,620
Do not let him leave.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on my way.
