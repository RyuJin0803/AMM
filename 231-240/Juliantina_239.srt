1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Look who it is.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,360
El Chino Valdés himself.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,620
What's up, Alacrán?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
I don't know how you managed to escape from us for so long.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,420
But your time is up.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,660
Stop the stupidity and let her go.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,260
Where is my USB?

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,320
And my money?

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,560
Money?

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,960
I don't have it anymore. I spent it all on women and tequila and...

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,520
Travelling and five star hotels.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,380
As for the USB, we'll arrange another meeting.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,800
Let my daughter go now!

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,900
There won't be another meeting, Chino.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:00,000
This all ends here.
