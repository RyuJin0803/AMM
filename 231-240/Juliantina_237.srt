1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,940
You have a call.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,720
He says it's El Chino.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,000
What do you want?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,600
Yes, hello?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,220
Put it on speaker.
Hello.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
What's going on, bro?

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,580
It's been a long time since I've known about you, right?

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,640
Since the cartel days.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,020
Would you look at that..

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,600
I finally hear your voice, Chino.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,660
Now all I need is to see your face.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,140
I'm going to make that wish come true.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,760
Do as I say.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,300
So, do what I say, okay!

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,920
Don't fuck with me.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,740
I have your daughter here.

17
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,340
Don't you dare touch her.

18
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,440
And if you want to see my face again...

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,580
You're going to do what I say.

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,160
[Motherfucker!]

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,260
Shameless!

22
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,780
Did you hear what I said or not?

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,460
Do you think Montilla has arrived at the narcos' house?

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm sure he has, yes.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,200
So why aren't they telling us anything?

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,560
Maybe we shouldn't have told the police and I was wrong.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,440
Do you want to go?

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,820
There?

29
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,640
Yes.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,620
It's so dangerous.

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,860
We can get closer and see what's happening. I'm sure the police have already entered and...

32
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,240
Maybe when we get there, they already have gotten Juliana out of there.

33
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,760
We could go stay at a..

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
Safe distance so we don't make anything worse, but so we're there.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,660
Yes.

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,360
Right?

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
For Juliana.

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,900
Thank you.

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:00:00,000
You're welcome.
