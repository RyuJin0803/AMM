1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
What if Valentina is right and one man isn't enough to rescue Juliana?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,880
I have to go to Alacrán's house.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,260
No, no, no, you're not going anywhere.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,460
Those guys have to keep thinking you're dead, Lupita.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm going to rescue Juliana.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,140
You don't know what those guys are capable of.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
If you go, you're going to complicate everything

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,580
And they are going to kill you.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,500
I don't care.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to save my daughter.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,060
No, no, no. Okay, okay.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,140
Let's plan something together..

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,300
But something sensible.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,440
Please.

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,020
Let me get you something to drink.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,580
But you have to stay calm, okay?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,340
Lupita...

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,760
Damn it.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,680
Do you realize that being here is like putting a rope around our own necks?

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,280
Hey?

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,200
Beltrán.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,940
I'm talking to you, Beltrán

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,120
Lower your voice.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm concentrating.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,100
Concentrating on what? How they're going to kill us?

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,920
Alacrán is a man of his word.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,880
As soon as I give him El Chino Valdés..

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,820
He will give me my daughter.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,500
That's your plan? To turn me in?

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,620
The plan is to rescue Juliana.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm sorry, brother.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,600
You would do exactly the same for your daughter.

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,400
So..

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,680
Give me your phone.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,140
Go on, I have a nervous finger.

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,480
Move.

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:00:00,000
Move.
