1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
And the narcos are looking for Juliana's dad so that is why they took her.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,680
Wow.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,740
I can't believe that..

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,700
Your driver is her dad and that he's a hitman.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,200
Nobody can believe it, it has all just come to light.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,820
If Juliana's mom managed to escape from the house where she was kidnapped..

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,100
Surely, she knows how to get back there.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,560
This is the whole point, it's that..

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,860
She is the only one who knows where that house is.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,020
What if we track her phone?

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,740
It's not that easy, you have to know how to do it  and...

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,520
Yes, yes, do you have her number?

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,660
No.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,400
I can get it.
Perfect, let's do it.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,680
Let's go.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,840
Are you serious?
Yes.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,720
Of course, let's go.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
