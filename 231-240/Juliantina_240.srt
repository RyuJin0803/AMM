1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
You were wrong to betray me, Chino!

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,320
Thanks to me, you made a lot of money.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:05,940
What happened?

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,300
I got tired and didn't want to keep doing this. I didn't want to be killed, as you all will be.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,220
The statistics say so.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,440
Statistics?

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
This guy has been seen a lot of movies.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,600
What was your plan, Chino?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,620
Escape with the money and set up a...

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,820
A small store.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,780
Why are you laughing?

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,080
It went wrong, huh?

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,340
Not that bad, right?

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,520
No?

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,200
You ended up in the electric chair.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,380
I ended up in the electric chair, but here I am, alive and kicking.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,060
And with the money and with the USB.

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,180
Let her go now!

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,180
I don't want to keep listening to you.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,340
Well, I have the money and the USB so let go of my daughter now!

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,920
I don't trust you.

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,560
We're doing things my way.

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,420
Give me the USB.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,340
Or I'll kill her first.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,160
Then I'll kill you.

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:00:00,000
Let my daughter go.
