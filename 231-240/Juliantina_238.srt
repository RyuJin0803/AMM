1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,360
El Chino is coming for you.

2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,760
Chino will never come for me.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,880
I'd take advantage and say goodbye.

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,280
I don't want to see Chino.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,400
Perfect.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,400
Today, he's going to die.

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,160
Go.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,680
Go, go, go.
I am.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,080
So, is she still there?
She's still there. She's still there.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,040
Take this left.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,960
Hurry, hurry. Please.
We're going. Valentina. Calm down, I'm going.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm doing what I can.
Go, go, go.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,400
Go out. Let's go.

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,140
I'm going, wait.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,040
Remember, lower your head. Lower your head.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,560
Less. You're not begging for forgiveness.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,560
Okay, okay.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,100
That's it. Stare. When you see him..

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,600
Look tough.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,260
Drop your shoulders. And forward, that's it.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,300
You're going to say things that you've never said.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,340
You're going to let go. Let out the animal you have inside.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,180
That's it. Be confident.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,880
Huh?

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,360
Like that.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
I really don't like this place, Beltrán.

27
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,400
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,280
What do you mean keep walking. Do you not care about your body getting shot?

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,280
I don't care, it's important that you walk.

30
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,860
This is not safe, Beltrán.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,720
You're right, it's not safe.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,460
Walk! If you stop, you'll be a dead man, damn it.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm covering you.
