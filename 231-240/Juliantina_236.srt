00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
I didn't know you had this hacker side to you.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,540
See, I'm not that stupid. I also have a geek side.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,180
Lupita has been in the same place for a while, it doesn't make sense.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,840
Well, here on the map, it looks like it’s in a residential zone and...

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,720
Maybe she got there and is waiting for an opportunity to enter? I don't know.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,880
I think it’s best if you send that to Montilla, right?

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm going to save these to your photos so you can send them by WhatsApp.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,360
Okay.

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,680
Tell me.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,340
Montilla, I'm Valentina Carvajal.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,720
I just sent the location of where I think my friend Juliana is, to your phone.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
Are you talking about the girl that was kidnapped?

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,240
Yes

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,000
Juliana.

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,780
How do you have the location?

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,460
Because.. Because...

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,700
We tracked down her mom who was kidnapped in the same place and she said she was going to rescue her.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Mrs Lupita went to Alacrán's house?

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,900
That's what I'm trying to say. Please do something.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on my way.
