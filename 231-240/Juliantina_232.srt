1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Yes, okay.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,400
Bye.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,220
What's up? What happened?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,880
I'm so..

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,540
I'm so scared.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
Here, sit down.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,200
Tell me, what happened?
Juliana was kidnapped.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,260
Jacobo's daughter?

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,840
Jacobo, Chino, I don't even know what his name is anymore.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,540
Do you know who took her?

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,680
The same people who took her mom, but

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,800
We really have to do something, LucÃ­a because

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,240
No one is doing anything, okay?

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,200
Let's publish the news.

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,400
Yes.
Yes?

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, we'll do whatever it takes.

17
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,520
Please, because..
Yes, yes.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,420
Count on it. Calm down.

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,740
The police aren't doing anything.

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
No, the police will...
No, they never do anything.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,340
They will do their job and we will do what we can at the newspaper.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,340
Don't think you've won yet because if Chino pulls one of his tricks..

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm going to eat a taco of his grilled daughter.

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:00,000
And I know where I'm going to start.
