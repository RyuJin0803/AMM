1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Look, look.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,360
I can explain, although, it is complicated.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,560
Juliana, no? Juliana?

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,720
Juliana.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,420
It turns out that,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,800
Jacobo Reyes died and reincarnated in the body of,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,420
El Chino ValdÃ©s.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,600
Your father.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,460
It's absurd.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,320
Are you serious?
I'm very serious.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,240
Are you talking seriously?

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,960
It's complicated,

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,620
Very difficult to understand but what I'm doing is very serious.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,580
Believe me, please, yeah?

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,900
It's absurd. It doesn't make sense, right? No..

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,980
That doesn't happen.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,080
This has to do with what I have been practicing.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,440
What I am studying, the migration of souls.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Yes?

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,240
What I read in your first book?

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,520
It has to do with reincarnation which is completely different to transmigration.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,240
This is when the human dies, but he keeps the conscience of their previous life.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,820
Juliana, if you want I could give you my first book so you can study...

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:00:00,000
Camilo, what I don't understand is, if El Chino is not Juliana's dad, then who is he?
