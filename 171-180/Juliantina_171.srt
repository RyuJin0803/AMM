Hello, Silvina.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
Good morning.
Good morning.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,960
Guille.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,160
How are you, little sister?

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Better.

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,040
Do you have a second? I just found out something very important.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,120
What happened?

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,360
It turns out that Jacobo is Juliana's dad.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,340
Juliana, your friend?

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,680
...Yes.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,300
Why didn't we know before?

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,940
I don't know, they just found out too.

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,420
Juliana and her mom have been looking for him for a while, not knowing that he worked at the house.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,860
Seriously?

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
That's weird.

16
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,820
I know, what worries me is that Juliana said her dad is a hitman.

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,080
What?
I swear.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,560
Look, Valentina, you know what you're saying is very serious.

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,400
Are you sure?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
I know, my reaction was the same.

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,060
Does LucÃ­a know?

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't think so.

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,620
I'm trying to find her but Chivis said she is not here, so I can't talk to her.

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,940
She's probably in the office.

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,500
I need to tell her, she needs to know.

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,720
Yes. I agree, that would be great.

27
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,200
It's better to do it in person so there are no misunderstandings.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Besides, we are going to go to Camilo's house because at the end of the day,

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,820
He recommended Jacobo and I want to know why he recommended a hitman.

30
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,380
Please let me know what he says.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Take care, okay? Tell me what happens with you, too.
