1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
I'm sorry to take you out of your house when you still don't feel good.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,780
Look, I think it's better to be here than to be locked at home.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,540
How are you feeling because I saw you..

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,500
You were a little shocked by what Camilo said.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Well..

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,980
Val, honestly, it's gonna take a bit of work for me to believe all of these..

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,120
Things, but..

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,920
Can I say something?

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,380
That book is..

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,060
Very magical.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,860
You have to give it a chance, because if not...

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,820
Obviously, you're going to be skeptical and not to believe,

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,900
But it changed my life.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Look.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,660
I even have it marked.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,660
This phrase.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,720
"Different spiritual disciplines affirm that souls reincarnate in the same family, either blood or friendship.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,980
Think about it, it makes sense.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,700
It does make sense.
Also, if that's true...

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,780
I could meet with my family again and..

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
You could have been my...

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,520
Prince Charming in another life.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,140
Which..

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,540
Makes so much sense and would explain a lot of things, don't you realize?

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,820
Yes.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,940
With that argument, I think...

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:00:00,000
I could start believing in these things.
