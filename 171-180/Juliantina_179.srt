1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
No, where are you going?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,620
Explain to me what this is.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,460
Because I've seen you kissing.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,200
You've been fooling me this whole time.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,900
What did you do to my daughter?
Mom, what is wrong with you?

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,520
She didn't do anything to me.

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,540
This is ours.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm your mother, I know you've never done anything wrong.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,480
This is not wrong.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,220
Love isn't a perversion, okay?

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,720
And I'll tell you one thing.

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,300
This is the most beautiful thing I've felt in my entire life.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,860
What love? She took advantage of you.
Mom, Mom.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,040
Calm down.

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,280
She didn't take advantage of me.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,600
Of course she did.

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,360
Who else knows about this?

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,280
Get out!
Mom, Mom, Mom, hey!

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,240
What do you mean "get out?"

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,020
You're going to throw her out of the house that she lent you?

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,080
Do you need something, miss?

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:00:00,000
No.
