1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,820
Why did you do this to me?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,360
What the hell did I do wrong? Where did I fail?

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,120
This isn't your fault. This isn't about you, okay?

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,500
It isn't anyone's fault.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,060
I didn't know that I was going to fall in love with a woman either.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,520
You don't know what you are saying.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,260
I do know what I'm saying.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,700
I've never fell in love with anyone...

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,800
And it turns out that the first human being I fall in love with, happens to be a woman.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,500
So what!

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,660
Can’t you understand that?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,500
No.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,440
And don't even think that I'm going to let you ruin your life.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,260
So now with more reason, we are leaving the city.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,060
And another thing, we are leaving this house immediately because I don't want to owe that girl anything.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,980
Much less, she keeps dazzling you with her money.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,380
You know I'm not an idiot, right?

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not dazzled by anyone's money.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,120
And I'll tell you one thing...

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,720
I’m in love with Valentina and that is not going to change because you said so.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Hello.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,760
Here.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,920
They were kissing, Panchito.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,680
I saw them, they were kissing

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,300
You were right.

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,080
Juliana had a secret.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
And that secret was Valentina.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,660
And?

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,360
"And"?

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,220
Yes, and?

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Do you think this is normal?

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,740
Well, yes.

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't see anything wrong with her and her friend falling in love.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,080
You're saying that, too? Now I'm the crazy one?

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,260
Lupita, please, calm down.

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:00:00,000
Don’t make a big deal about this.
