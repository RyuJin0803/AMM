1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
I think that..

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,960
It would be a big mistake to go to the police and turn in a man that really is..

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,180
Innocent.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,940
Jacobo Reyes is innocent.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,340
Okay, okay, so.. okay wait, so if..

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,580
Jacobo isn't Chino, then where is Chino's soul?

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,400
Disappeared? In another body?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,520
Those questions don't have answers yet.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,080
I don't have them, but I will, okay?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,360
Okay, good, then while we wait for answers, I have to go to the hospital.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
I have to talk to Jacobo because..

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,320
He is the closest thing I have to my dad.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,740
And he can tell me how things happened.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,480
But going there isn't safe.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,840
He is hospitalized and he just killed a narco.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,340
Don't go there.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,360
No, don't go.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,120
Yes, no.

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,940
I mean.. he has a point.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,940
I don't know if it's safe.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,040
When they discharge him, he is coming here and then you can come see him.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,120
Yeah, we should do that. When he's out, you..

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,500
You'll let us know and we'll come see him.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,420
I will, yes. Yes.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,140
Yes.

26
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,280
Girls, I need you to understand something important.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Jacobo Reyes is a great friend.

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,560
A true friend.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,420
Besides, I'm talking about an excellent human being.

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
A good guy.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Yes?

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,140
Camilo?

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Jacobo know my dad?
