1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,160
Val.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,960
We already talked about this.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,360
Val, it doesn't mean I stopped feeling what I feel for you.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,280
It's just, with all the things that are happening..

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,540
I don't think it's the right time for us to be together.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Val.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Look at me.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,220
If this reincarnation thing you say is true,

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,120
Maybe we will find each other again in another life.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
What if I'm your grandmother in that other life?

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,560
No...

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,520
I don't want you to be my grandmother.
I don't want you to be either.

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Juliana!

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:00:00,000
Mom.
