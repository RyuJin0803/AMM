1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
You want with or without butter?

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,600
Um, with.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,840
Yes? Are you sure?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,360
Here, take both.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,260
Do I look hungry?
Yes.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,960
So, are you going to believe?

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,360
If you keep giving me those nice arguments you were giving me,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,720
I'm going to believe.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,460
But

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,080
It's a lot of information, Val, it's not like..

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,660
Well, I'm not ruling out reincarnation,

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,580
But...

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,020
It's a lot of information.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,420
Wait a moment.

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,440
Did I hear right? I'm not ruling out reincarnation?

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,980
Wait, stop what you're doing, I need you to concentrate.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,460
Because evidently the idea isn't clear to you.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,940
You can't leave me alone on this.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
In what?
In this, in this absurd belief.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,600
What will people think of me if you don't believe? What will they say?

21
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,280
That you're crazy, obviously.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,880
You're so crazy.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,240
How mean.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Why?

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,280
Sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a bit difficult, this whole transition.
