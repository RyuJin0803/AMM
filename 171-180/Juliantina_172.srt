1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,500
How are you?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,200
Hey.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,640
Good?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,080
This is Juliana.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,320
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,740
What's your name?
Juliana.

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,400
Ah, Juliana?

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Come in, please, come in.

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,880
Go ahead, go ahead, please.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,260
So, tell me..

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,940
How are you feeling?

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,040
Good.

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,260
I feel better with what you prescribed but that's not why we're here.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,340
It's a long story.

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,260
Valentina...

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,700
So, what is this about?

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,580
It's about...

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,600
Jacobo Reyes.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,220
Basically, we want to know why you're friend with a hitman.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,460
Juliana and her mom came here to escape from Texas because,

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,720
He abandoned them with a...

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,379
A gang of narcos chasing them.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,140
And now he appears at my home, recommended by you, becomes my driver,

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,340
And now he is saying that he's not her dad.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,240
Which obviously is a lie,

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,840
And I don't know how many people he has been lying to, but I'm not going to let him continue.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to the police.
