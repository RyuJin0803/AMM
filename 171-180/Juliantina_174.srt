1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
You have to know who Jacobo is, right? I mean..

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,740
Who is he?

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:06,880
Who is he?

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Valentina, Jacobo is a..

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,380
He is a great friend of mine from university, he is someone really..

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm really fond of. He is a very, very good, kind person.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,580
Okay... Well..

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,500
Iâ€™m sorry to say, but all of what you are saying is very complicated and

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,860
See, if this transmigration was a real thing,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,580
Everyone would know.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,940
People would be talking about it, it would be on the news.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,440
Totally.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,560
Totally, you're right. You're completely right, it's..

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,260
It happens that the topic of transmigration is not well known in the west.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,660
It has to do with other cultures, like Tibetan, millenary cultures.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,460
No, I'm sorry, I don't want to offend you,

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,400
But it seems like you took all of this from a movie or something.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,440
Yes, you're right. Of course, logically is to believe or not believe, to see or not believe.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
I agree with you.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,800
I completely agree with you, that what happens here.. There was a patient..

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,620
That patient,

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:21,720
Appeared with a regression and themes of... reincarnation and transmigration.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,400
What's important is that, I had to consult with my colleagues on all of this.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,620
We investigated and..

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,740
We found that death...

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,960
Doesn't end.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,900
Death transforms.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?
